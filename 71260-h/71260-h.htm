<h2><a id="AUTHORS_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>I am writing these lines, to-day the 6th of June, 1924, in this island
of Fuerteventura, an island that is propitious to calm thinking and to a
laying bare of the soul, even as this parched land is bare, bare even to
the bone. Here I have been confined now for nearly three months, no
reason for my confinement having been given other than the arbitrary
mandate of the military power that is de-civilizing and debasing my
native country.</p>

<p>Hither came my friend Mr. J. E. Crawford Flitch to bear me company. He
was entrusted by Mr. Alfred A. Knopf with the task of making an
anthology or <i>florilegium</i> of my shorter articles and extracts from my
more extensive writings which should present a conspectus of my whole
literary work. It is he, my friend and translator, who is responsible
for the selection of the pieces which form this anthology.</p>

<p>I am in principle an enemy of all such selections or anthologies of an
author’s works, and the more so when the author’s influence is due
primarily not so much to his ideas as to the passionate tone and gesture
with which he expresses them, to his style. This work of selection
appears to me to be as difficult as would be that of abridging a sonata
or a picture. And what appears to me almost impossible is that the
author<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> himself should make the selection. It is not possible for us to
see ourselves from the outside, to become part of our public.</p>

<p>In any case, a work like this is a kind of index or catalogue, and its
chief utility is to incite in the public a desire to get to know the
author better. It is, to put it bluntly, in the nature of an
advertisement.</p>

<p>Collections of selected writings are most valuable when the chief
importance of an author lies in his ideology, which may or may not be
welded into a system; they are less valuable when he is distinguished
not so much by his ideas as by the warm images which incarnate them. It
is relatively easy to give a summary of an author when we are asked:
“What does he say?” but not so easy when the question to be answered is:
“How does he say it?” That is to say, it is possible to abridge a
philosophic system, but not a poem. In the poem, that which we call the
argument is the most external element of its form, and its essence, the
essence of the poem, is the rhythm, the aroma of the words, the style.
Rhythm may give birth to argument or subject, but subject does not
always give birth to rhythm.</p>

<p>In selecting these pieces&#8212;torsos, arms and heads of statuary&#8212;my friend
the translator has been guided by an artistic rather than by a
philosophical or ideological criterion, and for this I am grateful to
him. And when I say that I am grateful to him, I mean that in this way
he has best served the public that seeks to know me&#8212;me, the man, and
not a system, for I have no system. Like Walt Whitman I would say of
each one of my works: “This is not a book, it is a man.” It is
com<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span>paratively easy, for example, to synthetize the philosophical system
of Descartes, or that of Kant, or that of Hegel, or that of Comte, or,
still more so, that of Spencer; but it is not easy to synthetize Goethe
or Nietzsche, in both of whom is a latent philosophy. And still less so
to synthetize Dante, Milton, Cervantes, Shakespeare. And it has not been
the object of my translator to present a summary of an ideology but to
give an impression of a spirit.</p>

<p>To elucidate this point still further would lead us into an intricate
examination of the relations which subsist between a man and his work,
and to inquire whether the man makes the work or the work makes the man
or whether each makes the other at the same time. The man makes himself
in making his work and the work makes itself in making the man. The
Creation makes God the Creator, and God the Creator makes the Creation,
the Universe.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, is not every translation in effect a new and original
work? In being turned into English, however faithful the translator may
be, shall I not say something different from what I have said in
Spanish? Does a song say the same when played on the violin, the flute,
the harp, the bassoon? Is a sonata the same when played on the piano and
the organ? I know that when I have read my writings translated into
another language I have been aware of echoes and reverberations which
lay sleeping in the depths of my spirit, I have glimpsed horizons which
the firm and severe contours of my native tongue did not permit me to
see. And I have sometimes thought of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> a new work based upon a
retranslation of the translation.</p>

<p>Among these essays is one upon the religion of Quixotism. Hitherto I
have been meditating and perhaps dogmatizing upon this religion&#8212;now I
am living it. For it is here, where the waves murmur tidings of my
native shores, the mountainous coast of the wild Bay of Biscay, it is
here that I have felt most deeply all the melancholy grandeur of the
ridiculous passion of the Knight of the impossible Chimera. While the
cowardly comic-opera tyrants who have banished me here are dishonouring
our Spain, her whom they call their mother, I am exalting and
eternalizing her, and I call her my daughter.</p>

<p>There is a famous Spanish couplet which says that there is no handful of
earth without a Spanish grave&#8212;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>No hay un puñado de tierra</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sin una tumba española,</i><br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and it would seem that these unhappy rulers wish to extend the national
graveyard. And I propose that there shall be no corner of heaven without
a nest of Spanish thought.</p>

<p>Nests of Spanish thought are the pieces which compose this book.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>And now I return to contemplate the sea, to feed my spirit upon it, to
watch its white-crested waves which are born and die and succeed one
another like the generations of men and of men’s works in the sea of
history. I return to contemplate the all-consoling sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> which smiles,
with its superhuman smile, upon our tragic human frailties.</p>

<p>Greeting! my readers of the English-speaking world. And when, having
read this book, you wish me farewell, may you carry with you something
of the quixotesque passion which I have put into my work and which is
the life of my life.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>No writer ever stood less in need of an introduction than Miguel de
Unamuno, for probably none ever revealed himself so naturally and so
nakedly in his writings. The identity between the author and the man is
absolute. He has a way of putting the whole of himself into all that he
writes so that to read him is not merely to learn his views as a
philosopher or a publicist, but to know his loves and hates, his hopes
and despairs, as a man of flesh and bone. His method of communicating
his message is not to address an audience from the elevation of the
pulpit or the platform, but to accost the individual face to face, to
grasp him warmly by the hand, to look him full in the eyes and tell him
what is in his heart. The task of the introducer therefore may be
restricted to prefixing to the intimacy so immediately established
between reader and author some few notes relative to the latter’s
history and the background against which he presents himself.</p>

<p>The determining events in his outward biography are soon told. Miguel de
Unamuno y Jugo was born in Bilbao on September 29, 1864. Although he
comes of pure Basque stock, Unamuno’s mother-tongue was Castilian, a
fact which precludes the supposition that the idiosyncrasies of his
style are to be attributed to an early familiarity with the Basque
speech. His father, who had spent most of his life in Mexico, died in
1870.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span> Four years later Bilbao was besieged and bombarded by the Carlist
troops, the first shell falling only a few houses away from that in
which his family was living. The events of the siege naturally made a
lively impression upon the mind of the ten-year-old boy. At the first
sound of the horns blown to give warning of the renewal of the
bombardment, the family took shelter with the neighbours in the cellars,
from which the youngsters sallied forth to collect the still burning
fragments of the shells. The schools were closed and the whole town
became an extended playground, offering to the idle schoolboys the novel
liberty of clambering about roofless churches and conducting miniature
bombardments of ruined houses with projectiles gathered from the debris.
This exciting holiday was terminated by the entry of the liberating
troops on May 2, 1874. These personal experiences of Spain’s last civil
war provided Unamuno with a background for his first novel, <i>Paz en la
Guerra</i>.</p>

<p>The religious atmosphere of Unamuno’s home was that of a Catholicism
whose traditions of simple and heart-felt piety bore a certain affinity
to those of Anglo-Saxon Quakerism. The youthful Miguel was a member of
the guild or <i>Congregación</i> of San Luis Gonzaga and on the feast of
Corpus Christi used to walk in procession through the streets with
lighted candle in his hand and the medal of the order suspended upon his
breast. About the age of fourteen he passed through that phase of
spiritual ferment which usually characterizes the entrance of the soul
into puberty, a period of vague aspirations towards sanctity mingled
with the romanticism engendered in a lively imagination by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span> reading
of Ossian. This religious <i>Schwärmerei</i>, however, was tempered by the
course of philosophy prescribed by his study for his baccalaureate.
Introduced through the reading of the Catalan philosopher Balmes to the
works of Descartes, Kant and Hegel, he at once plunged into the vertigo
of metaphysics and proceeded to elaborate and transcribe into a twopenny
note-book a philosophical system of his own, “very symmetrical and
bristling with formulas.”</p>

<p>In 1880 Unamuno went to Madrid to continue his studies. Passionately
attached to his native Bilbao and the wild mountain country in which all
his youthful summers had been passed, Unamuno has related how he entered
Madrid with tears in his eyes. His spirit never became acclimated to the
atmosphere of the capital and the years which he spent there were
rendered unhappy by his sense of isolation and home-sickness,
preoccupations with ill health, intellectual strain and acute spiritual
crises. Having taken his doctor’s degree in philosophy and letters, he
presented himself as a candidate for a professorship, first in
psychology, logic and ethics, and then in metaphysics; but no doubt
owing to a certain uncompromising independence of mind and contempt of
the conventional curriculum, he failed to obtain the suffrages of the
examiners. After two further unsuccessful attempts to obtain a chair in
Latin, he was finally appointed to a professorship in Greek by a board
presided over by the famous scholar Menendez y Pelayo. After returning
to Bilbao, where he married, he took up his residence in Salamanca in
1891. There he conducted two courses of lectures, one on Greek
literature, the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span> on the evolution of the Castilian language, and
nine years later, in 1900, he was appointed to the Rectorship of the
University.</p>

<p>Unamuno has always been possessed of a formidable capacity for work. His
scholastic activities, his administrative duties as head of the
University, his participation in municipal affairs, absorbed only a
portion of his energies. An omnivorous reader, he is familiar not only
with the cultures of the ancient world but with all the modern
literatures of Europe and America, most of which his extensive knowledge
of languages has enabled him to read in the original. But the fertility
of his mind and spirit manifested itself above all in a continual stream
of creative work, taking the manifold forms of essays, poetry, novels,
criticism and philosophy. His career as a publicist coincided with the
period following Spain’s disastrous war with the United States, during
which the fortunes of his country appeared to be at their lowest ebb.
Unamuno at once took a foremost place in that group of writers and
public men, known as “the generation of ’98,” who were preoccupied with
the problem of national regeneration. Whereas the majority of the
regenerationists, however, pointed to “modernization” and
“Europeanization” as the only possible path leading to material and
cultural progress, Unamuno advocated a return to the eternal tradition
of Spain and held that a spiritual renaissance was the necessary
pre-condition of her restoration as a world-power.</p>

<p>It was impossible for a man with so deep and intimate a love for his
country to confine himself to the publication of general encyclicals
from a professorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_7">{7}</a></span> and not to step down into the stormy arena of
practical politics. Without identifying himself with any one of the
official political parties, Unamuno conducted a personal and independent
campaign by means of newspaper articles and public addresses, frankly
and fearlessly denouncing abuses and corruption wherever he discerned
them, whether displayed in the acts of rulers or inherent in the
governmental system of the country. Such outspoken criticism from one
who held his appointment from the state savoured too much, to the
government of the day, of insubordination and was reproved accordingly
by his removal from the office of Rector of the University of Salamanca.
Some time afterward, in virtue of two articles which he published in a
Valencia newspaper, the ex-Rector was deemed to have contravened the law
of <i>lèse-majesté</i>, for which offence he was formally condemned by the
courts to a period of sixteen years’ imprisonment. The sentence, which
was of course never intended to be carried out, was subsequently
annulled by the royal grant of pardon.</p>

<p>The <i>coup d’état</i> of September, 1923, by which General Primo de Rivera
suspended the constitution and established the Military Directory,
naturally aroused Unamuno’s vehement protestation. Liberty of speech,
however, formed no part of the program of the new régime and the
Dictator, dispensing with the customary civil processes of writ, trial
and judgment, replied by an arbitrary decree of deportation. On Feb. 21,
1924, Unamuno received notice to prepare to proceed within twenty-four
hours under escort to Fuerteventura, the most remote and barren of the
Canary<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span> Islands. It is possible that the authorities might have been
willing to connive at the flight of their captive to the Portuguese
frontier, distant only some eighty miles from Salamanca; but Unamuno
refused to relieve them from any of the embarrassment which the
consequences of their action might entail. He packed up the few
necessaries for his journey, put a couple of books in his pocket&#8212;the
Greek New Testament and Leopardi’s poems&#8212;and awaited the arrival of the
escort.</p>

<p>The news of the banishment of one of Spain’s foremost writers and
patriots was received with a spontaneous outburst of denunciation both
at home and abroad. Numerous councils of universities and learned
societies in Europe and America passed resolutions of protest; the
newspaper press of almost every country published articles by
representative literary men condemning the action of the government and
testifying to the universality of the esteem which Unamuno had won in
the international republic of letters. The Directory was compelled to
recognize that the sole result of its act of petty tyranny had been to
raise the prestige of its victim and damage its own. A project for the
rescue of the exile was secretly organized in France, but its fruition
was forestalled by the publication of a decree of amnesty in July, 1924.
Unamuno embarked on the sailing-ship which had been dispatched for his
deliverance and on arriving at Madeira took ship to Cherbourg. Although
free to return to Spain, he felt that under the present régime his
liberty of action would be too much circumscribed and therefore
preferred to take up his residence temporarily in Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>I think that it was in the year 1912 when travelling in Spain that I
chanced to buy a book entitled <i>Mi Religión y Otros Ensayos</i> by Miguel
de Unamuno. Both the book and its author were then unkown to me. Before
I had read many pages I knew that I was listening to a voice that spoke
with that accent of sincerity and intimacy which gives the assurance of
immediate contact with a living man, a man of flesh and bone, a man who
had suffered, despaired, hoped and struggled with an intensity that
burned in every word. Next year was published <i>Del Sentimiento Trágico
de la Vida</i>, that passionate record of the adventures of the spirit that
takes its place with the self-revelations of St. Augustine, Pascal,
Amiel and Kierkegaard. I resolved that if I could accomplish it this
voice should be heard in the countries that speak the English tongue.
The War intervened, and it was not until 1920 that I found myself in
Salamanca with the typewritten sheets of the translation of “The Tragic
Sense of Life” ready to be submitted to the author for revision.</p>

<p>I well remember how, on the afternoon after my arrival, I was sitting in
a café on the Plaza Mayor when the door opened and my eyes fell upon the
arresting figure of a man half-way through the fifties, clad in a
double-breasted blue-serge jacket with a rim of white collar falling
over a kind of clerical waistcoat that was void of the usual triangular
opening for the display of shirt and necktie, his head crowned by a
round parsonical black hat. There was an almost aggressive announcement
of bluff health and energy in the erect carriage of the body, the alert
set of the head on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> squared shoulders, the thick brush-like crop of
iron-grey hair, the crisp curl of the close-trimmed beard that
emphasized rather than masked the firm lines of the jaw, the keen glance
behind gold-rimmed spectacles of eyes that gleamed bright and brown like
the eyes of a bird of prey. It would have been difficult for one to whom
he was a stranger to have guessed his vocation from his appearance.
Certainly never was philosopher less sicklied o’er with the pale cast of
thought. The tan that bronzed a skin glowing with the flush of health
seemed to tell of a life that was spent in the air of the mountains
rather than in the study. It could scarcely be doubted that the figure
standing there in the doorway was that of a man of action and a fighter.</p>

<p>During the course of the next two months I had ample opportunity to
observe the daily routine of Unamuno’s life at Salamanca. An early
riser, he may be seen in the streets before nine o’clock on his way to
the lecture-room. After the midday <i>comida</i>, at which he usually
abstains from both wine and meat, he is accustomed to take his coffee at
the Circulo Salmantino with a group of friends whose thought and
convictions are as widely varying as their occupations&#8212;university
professors, students, doctors, magistrates, writers, poets and men of
business. The quite unacademic conversation ranges over the whole gamut
of human interests. While the talk is flowing freely or the argument
being waged, Unamuno&#8212;who, by the way, is a non-smoker&#8212;may sometimes be
seen folding square sheets of paper with deft fingers into complicated
geometrical patterns which presently grow into astonishingly realistic
shapes<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span> of animals. Before the party breaks up, his table is not
infrequently covered with a menagerie of pigs, jumping frogs, vultures
and other wildfowl, to the no small delight of the street urchins whose
noses are flattened against the other side of the wide plate-glass
window. This <i>arte salmatino</i>, as its inventor calls it, presents
baffling constructional problems, the solutions of which are sometimes
thought out upon abstract geometrical principles in the sleepless
watches of the night.</p>

<p>When most of the members of the <i>tertulia</i> have withdrawn either to take
their afternoon siesta or resume their avocations, Unamuno sets out for
a long walk into the country, accompanied in winter by the few who are
willing to brave the icy winds that sweep over the treeless tableland
from the snow-clad summits of the sierras. During the walk the
conversation is continued without intermission, the party halting to
form a circle round the speaker whenever a point arises that demands
special emphasis or elucidation. As these points arise at frequent
intervals, a spectacle that must often arrest the wondering gaze of the
peasant hurrying on his mule along the high road to Salamanca on wintry
afternoons, is that of a group of individuals muffled in greatcoats and
waterproofs, with collars raised and hat-brims pulled down in a vain
endeavour to protect tingling ears from the lashing flaws of rain and
sleet, gathered round a robust, coatless figure, with double-breasted
blue jacket thrown open to the blast, whose concentration upon the
subject-matter of his discourse renders him apparently oblivious of the
inclemency of the elements and the physical discomfort of his auditors.
The point having been elucidated, the party struggles<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span> on again in the
teeth of the gale, some of its weaker members perhaps hoping that no
fresh dialectical crisis will arise until further exercise has restored
the benumbed circulation.</p>

<p>On days of storm or heavy rain, when faint-hearted disciples shrink from
the exposure of the open country, the afternoon diversion takes the form
of a promenade beneath the arcades of the Plaza Mayor, perhaps the
finest square of its kind in Spain, into which towards evening most of
the population of the city seems to empty itself. The crowd surges round
in two opposing streams, for a time-honoured custom demands that the men
shall proceed in one direction and the women in another. Unamuno
diversifies the monotony of this promenade by a curious amusement.
Having abstracted the crumb from his luncheon roll and kneaded it up
into a kind of snowball, he manufactures therefrom a supply of pellets,
and these, during the course of his walk, he propels by means of a
dexterous flick of the middle finger with deadly accuracy at selected
members of the crowd. Whether the principle of selection is based upon
friendly interest or personal dislike, or whether indeed there is any
principle at all, is a question that must be left undetermined.</p>

<p>About dusk he returns home and withdraws to his study, a spacious, lofty
square room, the plain workshop of the intellectual worker, furnished
only with a large writing-table, a few simple chairs, and crowded
bookshelves which not only surround the walls but occupy most of the
floor-space. A brazier underneath the table emits from its white ashes a
faint warmth scarcely perceptible to ordinary senses. Having re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span>freshed
himself with a drink of cold water, Unamuno takes up the work in hand
and writes until the hour arrives for the evening meal with his family.
The theatre does not attract him&#8212;I only saw him present once when Ibsen
was being played&#8212;and it is very seldom that a social function keeps him
from going to bed betimes.</p>

<p>Profound as is his attachment to the city which has been his home for
over thirty years, Unamuno always welcomes an opportunity to escape from
streets and squares into the open country and the mountains. His
knowledge of the Peninsula, as his books of travel testify, is both wide
and intimate. His visits to the more distant provinces are of course
reserved for the vacations, but during term-time his week-ends and the
holidays occurring on the seasonal feasts are often spent in the regions
of the Sierra de Gredos and the Peña de Francia. During these excursions
he touches life at a multiplicity of centres and penetrates into all the
various social strata. At every stage of the journey&#8212;at the railway
stations, in the train, at the local club, in the inn, in the village
shop or the peasant’s cottage&#8212;he is usually to be seen at the centre of
a group of men, discussing local affairs and politics, inquiring into
the technique of trades, saturating himself in the atmosphere of popular
thought and belief. His knowledge and love of Spain are thus fed by a
familiarity with the inner life of the people, the intra-historical
life, as he calls it, the life that flows by unobserved for the most
part by politicians and publicists and never agitates the surface of
history.</p>

<p>A minor outcome of this contact with the people, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> with the <i>charros</i>
or peasants of the province of Salamanca in particular, has been the
enrichment of his vocabulary by many of those pungent, expressive and
sometimes beautiful words and locutions which have long since
disappeared from literary Spanish but still abound in peasant speech.
This racy idiom of the soil often gives a peculiar tang to Unamuno’s
writing. When accused by the literary critic, as not infrequently
happens, of sprinkling his prose with words unearthed from the dusty
works of some sixteenth or seventeenth-century author, he will reply
that the so-called archaisms, though possibly unfamiliar in literary
coteries, still enjoy a vigorous life in the speech of the people.</p>

<p>It will no doubt have been already gathered that Unamuno, like all good
Spaniards, delights in talk. Indeed, some of those who have observed how
considerable a part of his leisure is spent in general conversation may
have wondered how and when he finds time for the production of the large
volume of his writing. The answer is that much of his thought is
generated and shaped into form in the act of talking. He has a
disrelish, amounting almost to a prejudice, for writing that has not the
vibration and elasticity of living speech, the prose of men who are
usually found to be non-talkers. “Ideas come with talking,” I have heard
him say. “One must speak, one must have to put one’s thought into words,
one must hear how the words sound spoken. Writing for oneself is not
enough.” It is in the conversational encounter, in the face-to-face
conflict of disputants, in the exertion to convince an opponent, to
unravel a difficulty, to press home a personal conviction, that his mind
is strung to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span> its highest tension, seizes upon the aptest and keenest
words with an instinctive sense of their effective values and wields
them like sharp and flashing weapons. Returning to his study after a
discussion at the Circulo Salmantino or an afternoon’s discourse on the
wind-swept heights above the Tormes, he transcribes with the speed of
dictation the substance of his argument or homily in phrases still
vibrating with the passion of the spoken word. Hence his prose retains
in a degree exceptional even in Spanish literature the qualities of
animated talk&#8212;rapid, emphatic, exclamatory, elliptical, disjointed,
charged with intonation and gesture. And this written talk, it must be
noted, never develops into written oratory, for it is addressed in the
first instance not to the general public but to the personal
interlocutor; it is the continuation or recapitulation of talk with a
friend, or the reply to the confessions of a correspondent, or sometimes
the communing of the writer with <i>alter ego</i>.</p>

<p>There are times when the channel of written speech seems to afford too
narrow an outlet for the flood of passion storming through it. Unamuno
seems to be impatient of the mutism of the printed page, as if, like the
written score of music, it were incomplete lacking embodiment in sound.
The written symbols are an inadequate substitute for the bodily
presence, incapable of conveying the conviction, the force, the sense of
mass, which only the living organism with all its full-charged vitality
can impart. It might even be conjectured that for Unamuno writing is
after all only a <i>pis-aller</i>&#8212;he would prefer to talk, or rather he
would prefer to dispense with words altogether and impose himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> in
some transcendental act of communion. Of one of Goya’s pictures, the
tumultuous <i>Third of May</i> in the Prado, the Italian critic De Amicis
says: “It is the last point which painting can reach before being
transmuted into action; having passed this point, one throws away the
brush and seizes the dagger.” A similar sense of an intolerable
straining of the medium is sometimes felt in reading Unamuno. The
texture of language is stretched to the breaking-point; words are
contorted in an endeavour to force them beyond the limits of their
capacity; grammar and syntax collapse before the rush of passionate
utterance. It is the pressure and drive of a whole personality that
seeks to translate itself into words and finds in the end that it is
untranslatable.</p>

<p>The impulse towards action and the exertion of personal influence which
forms one of the dominant features of Unamuno’s character, finds a
considerable part of its expression in his participation in the public
affairs of his country. He has little patience with the view that the
scholar or professor ought to stand aside from the larger issues of the
day in order to devote all his energies to perfecting himself as a
machine for grinding out erudition and culture. Indeed, he considers
that politics are themselves an invaluable instrument of culture, in
that for large masses of the people they provide the principal, perhaps
the only avenue of approach to a consideration of general ideas.
Devoting himself in his political activities primarily to the exposition
of these general ideas, the basic principles of citizenship, Unamuno has
always evinced a whole-hearted contempt for that preoccupation with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
political machinery and an intrigue which tends to make the professional
politician, particularly perhaps in Spain, little more than an
electioneerer. Unamuno is among the prophets rather than the
politicians, and his followers form not a party but a band of disciples.
“All round the ring,” he said to me once, “sit the spectators. They
applaud or hiss. But down in the arena, there I fight alone, face to
face with the bull.”</p>

<p>To the suggestion sometimes expressed by his well-wishers that he should
withdraw from the arena in order to devote himself more exclusively to
poetry and philosophy, Unamuno would reply that this poetry and
philosophy are simply the outcome of his intense, energetic and
passionate living. If he had never known the dangers, the ardours, the
hopes and despairs of battle, his poetry might have withered for lack of
roots. <i>Primum vivere, deinde philosopari</i>&#8212;the philosopher must first
live before he can philosophize. And the end of life, Unamuno has said,
is living, not understanding. Nothing is more repugnant to his spirit
than the conception of æsthetics embodied in the catch-phrase, “art for
art’s sake.” The idea that letters can be separated from life and
literature produced <i>in vacuo</i> is inconceivable to one whose impulse to
write springs directly from his zeal to affect and mould life. Unamuno
provides yet another corroboration of Tchekov’s maxim that all great
writers have axes to grind.</p>

<p>If the object of Unamuno’s political opponents in banishing him from the
society of his fellows to the ocean-girt desert of Fuerteventura was to
reduce his spirit to submission, they little knew the man they had to
deal with. He has never overprized the amenities<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span> of civilization and it
is probable that he would have felt much more in exile if he had been
condemned to live in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Tenerife or Las
Palmas. The Canaries have been identified with the Fortunate Isles of
the ancient world, and Unamuno remarked humorously that Fuerteventura
was indeed fortunate among islands in being one where there were no
hotels <i>de luxe</i>, no bull-fights, no cinemas, no football, no
boy-scouts. But apart from its lack of the more futile expedients for
killing time, there is something in the spirit and even in the structure
of this stern and naked island that was in harmony with Unamuno’s
temperament. It is, as he phrased it, not merely <i>desnudo</i> but
<i>descarnado</i>, not merely without vesture but without flesh. Like a
bleached skeleton in the sun, it reveals every articulation of its
structure. In its landscape everything fugitive gives place to what is
enduring and elemental; it bears the impress of eternity rather than of
time. Living in this austere but serene ambience, between the mountains
and the sea, Unamuno found a refreshment of mental and spiritual energy,
the activity of his inner life was perhaps never more intense and what
he wrote during his four months’ exile was quarried from those deeper
strata of his spirit where thought and passion lie embedded in a single
matrix.</p>

<p>In Puerto de Cabras, the cluster of low whitewashed houses that forms
the principal port of the island, time flowed in a tranquil stream that
was scarcely agitated by the weekly arrival of the steamer bringing the
mail, provisions, water, and out-of-date newspapers from Las Palmas. For
the safer custody of the exile, fifty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span> <i>guardias civiles</i> had been
drafted to the island and stationed in couples at various points round
the coast. Every letter which he wrote or received was first opened and
censored by police officials. In other respects his liberty of movement
within the island was not interfered with and he was free to visit the
distant villages that are sparsely scattered like oases in the midst of
the stone-strewn wilderness of extinct volcanoes. Unamuno occupied a
room overlooking the sea in the principal <i>fonda</i> of the port. He
usually rose before the bell of the little church on the other side of
the wide cobbled street had rung for six o’clock Mass, and spent the
morning working in his bedroom or composing a sonnet as he paced up and
down the flat roof, bare-headed and stripped to the waist, in the sun.
After a frugal lunch&#8212;the diet of Fuerteventura is of a Spartan
simplicity!&#8212;he took a siesta during the heat of the afternoon and
afterward strolled along the rock-bound shore or the <i>carretera</i> that
leads into the interior of the island. Although the action can scarcely
have come within the compass of their duties, it was not surprising to
see the lounging soldiers spring to salute when their prisoner, with his
native air of authority and command, passed before the barracks-gate.
When the brief twilight fell and the camels, returning from browsing on
the scanty scrub, padded with muffled footfall through the darkening
street, Unamuno joined the circle of village notables who were wont to
assemble nightly on a row of chairs ranged on the pavement in front of
the general store. Then, until the tardy supper hour arrived, a flow of
philosophy, philology, paradox, travel-lore and political wisdom fell
upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span> astonished ears of the shopkeepers and petty officials of the
port. Fortunate islanders!</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no more distinguishing mark of greatness of character
than that patience and inner quietude which springs from assurance of
the ultimate efficacy of the force latent within the soul. No term had
been fixed to Unamuno’s banishment; it might have been his fate, for all
he knew, to have passed the best of his remaining years in the island
wilderness of Fuerteventura. But so far from chafing at his enforced
isolation and inaction, he seemed to be sustained by the consciousness
that it was beyond the power of circumstances to prevent the work to
which he had set his hand from accomplishing itself. Whatever might
happen to the sower, the seed that had been scattered would go on
bearing fruit. In the plans which his friends had made for his escape he
took an uneager and slightly amused interest. A point was fixed not far
from the port where it was arranged that between the hours of ten and
twelve at night the exile should await a boat that was to carry him to a
sailing-vessel lying somewhere off the coast. Owing to unforeseen
delays, the vessel did not finally arrive until after the decree of
banishment had been rescinded, and consequently many nights were spent
in frustrated watching beneath the shadow of a ruined tower standing on
a rocky ledge by the shore. These summer nights were breathlessly still,
the bright globe of the moon rose up out of the sea into a clear sky
thickly silvered with stars, the unrippled surface of the water
stretched between the arms of the bay like a sheet of metal. In the
distance the green harbour-light at the end of the stone jetty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span> gleamed
malignly. The only sound was the gurgling of the water in the hollows of
the rocks. The far horizon was void of any vestige of a sail. Twelve
o’clock came and the fruitless vigil was broken off. Not wholly
fruitless, perhaps, for during these tranquil hours of waiting Unamuno
kept a vigil of the spirit, the fruit of which will doubtless appear
when the poems of his exile are made known to the world.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Of the two elements which appear to be combined in every philosophy, the
impersonal, scientific investigation of the nature of reality and the
personal affective reaction to the scheme of things thus envisaged, it
is with the latter that Unamuno’s interest is overwhelmingly concerned.
It may be that it is not so much this attitude that singularizes him as
his candid avowal of it. At any rate, he himself appears to believe that
the impersonal methods of philosophy merely provide a conceptional
framework for the personal <i>Weltanschauung</i> of the philosopher. And the
core of this inward affective problem must always be, for the human
philosopher, the relation of man to the universe. It is this point where
philosophy and religion meet in considering the problem of human
destiny, that forms the burning focus of the main energies of Unamuno’s
thought and passion.</p>

<p>What distinguishes Unamuno from most other thinkers&#8212;and perhaps one
should say “feelers” rather than thinkers&#8212;is the intensity of his
realization and awareness of his own personality, of his own unique
individual being, and the passion with which he desires the indefinite
persistence of this being. This is the main<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span> ground for the charge of
egoism and egocentrism that has often been levelled against him. But so
far from driving him to a narrow self-centred individualism, this
passion is the source from which springs a generous sympathy with all
humanity. He rightly insists upon the fact that the problem of personal
immortality involves that of the future of the whole human species. His
passionate concern for his own destiny, his own salvation, Unamuno
transfers to all his brothers in humanity. The salvation of man, the
central problem of all religion, is the axis about which his thought and
emotion revolve. But it is salvation in what he understands to be the
Catholic rather than the Protestant sense, salvation not so much from
sin as from death, from annihilation.</p>

<p>To a man of the modern world, endowed with any special degree of
sensitiveness to his own personality, this problem tends to become
increasingly acute. The importance of man’s place in the universe is
seen to diminish in direct ratio to his knowledge with regard to it. In
the searchlight of science, the planet upon which he lives shrinks to
infinitesimal proportions in relation to the incommensurable cosmic
scheme; man takes his place no longer as the lord of creation but as an
apparently meaningless by-product of the play of irresponsible and
unconscious forces. This strange efflorescence of human consciousness in
an obscure corner of the universe would appear to be a transitory
phenomenon, resting upon an unstable equilibrium of natural forces and
destined to vanish completely when the inevitable working of these same
forces shall have dissipated the conditions under which life is able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
sustain itself on this planet. This sense of the doom of annihilation
impending over humanity is like a cloud looming upon the horizon of
Unamuno’s consciousness and throwing a menacing shadow upon the whole
terrestrial scene. It is the basis of his tragic sense of life. It
projects upon the screen of his mind that vision which so often seems to
occupy it, the vision of a world finally ordered and catalogued by human
science, of a civilization perfected after æons of agonized human
effort, existing without any human or other consciousness left to
appropriate it.</p>

<p>It may be said that in the contemplation of this vision the only
rational attitude for the human spirit to adopt is that of resignation
to mortality. But this counsel can only be given by those who are
affectively insensitive, and in Unamuno the will to live and to survive
are too imperious to submit to it unprotestingly. The note of passionate
protest rings in his writings. He inscribes upon his page the challenge
of Sénancour’s <i>Obermann</i>: “<i>L’homme est périssable. Il se peut; mais
périssons en résistant, et, si le néant nous est reservé, ne faisons pas
que ce soit une justice.</i>” Life refuses to abdicate to reason; between
the rationalistic and vitalistic attitude to existence there is an
impassable gulf. His own personal solution is found in the inspiration
and energy which he draws from this position of uncertainty and
conflict. “I will not make peace between my heart and my head,” he
cries; “rather let the one affirm what the other denies and the one deny
what the other affirms, and I shall live by this contradiction.” His
“Tragic Sense of Life,” which is the record of the encounter of his
spirit with the prob<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span>lems centring round the salvation of man from death
and annihilation, issues in the assertion that all virtue is based upon
“uncertainty, doubt, perpetual wrestling with the mystery of our final
destiny, mental despair, and the lack of any solid and stable dogmatic
foundation.” Convert <i>Obermann’s</i> sentence from its negative to a
positive form&#8212;“if it is nothingness that awaits us, let us so act that
it shall be an injustice”&#8212;and you get “the firmest basis of action for
the man who cannot or will not be a dogmatist.” A solution, perhaps, but
a desperate one.</p>

<p>Unamuno’s concern is not only with the salvation of man from nothingness
after death but also from the next-to-nothingness during life into which
he is plunged by the processes of an inhumane civilization. He is never
weary of affirming that man is an end in himself, not a means. He
protests passionately against the sacrifice of the individual concrete
man upon the altar of the abstract idea, whether the abstraction be that
of the state, of society, of progress, of posterity, or of humanity
itself. “They tell me that I am here to realize I know not what social
end; but I feel that I, like each one of my fellows, am here to realize
myself, to live.” This individualism, it must be noted, has nothing in
common with the anarchist’s undiscriminating revolt against society.
Nobody realizes more fully than this champion of individualism that man
is a social being, and that he can exist and grow to his full stature
only in society. But the point which he is insistent in emphasizing and
which so many social theorists appear to forget is that society exists
for man, not man for society. “The weak point in our social<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span>ism,” he
says, “is its confused notion of the supreme end of the individual
life.” He is led to question the value of our modern civilization&#8212;that
civilization which Spain is told by her would-be reformers that she
ought to assimilate&#8212;because it has arrived at a point at which it
suppresses rather than expands, enslaves rather than liberates, the life
of the individual. Man becomes exhausted with tending the machinery of
progress.</p>

<p>It is this distrust of the tendencies of modern Western civilization
that causes Unamuno to turn to the ancient, and&#8212;as he is willing to
consider&#8212;African, tradition of his own country. No native reformer or
foreign critic can have said harder things of his compatriots than
Unamuno. His essays reverberate with the sound of the lash with which he
chastises the besetting sins of the Spaniards of to-day, their servitude
to the spirit of routine, their intellectual and spiritual inertia,
their paralysing mutual suspicion and envy, their renunciation of the
life of adventure and danger. But Unamuno distinguishes between the
Spain of the passing generations and the Spain of the eternal tradition,
between the agitations that give a changing form to the surface and the
life that sleeps and dreams in the depths of subconsciousness. This
dreaming, undying, subliminal Spain is the Spain of his love and of his
faith. He appeals from Spaniards to Spain. He seeks to awaken this inner
Spain to full consciousness of itself. And when it awakens it is
possible that this Spain may be unable to find its expression in the
terms of our current civilization. The culture in which the intellect
and ideals of the advance-guard of the so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span>-called <i>Kulturvölker</i>
naturally clothe themselves, becomes an alien and ill-fitting garment
when forced upon the Iberian spirit. And perhaps the secret of this
difference lies in the greater importance in the Spanish social
structure of the part played by the concrete individual relatively to
the instruments of culture. “Other peoples,” Unamuno says, “have left
institutions, books&#8212;we have left souls.” His message to Spain might
perhaps be resumed in Whitman’s words: “Produce great Persons: the rest
follows.”</p>

<p>A cardinal tenet of Unamuno’s creed is the superlative value of the
individual soul. It is precious because it is unique and irreplaceable:
“There cannot be any other I.” In the whole world there is only one Juan
López or John Smith; the particular ingredients, good, bad or
indifferent, that have combined to form this unique individuality can
never again reunite in precisely the same proportions to form another
identical combination. This theory, or rather this sense, of the
uniqueness of personality may serve as the basis for an ethic. “Our
greatest endeavour must be to make ourselves irreplaceable; to make the
theoretical fact&#8212;that each one of us is unique and irreplaceable&#8212;a
practical truth.” The whole duty of man is to discover himself, to
discover his own reality, to discover what is unique in himself, to
bring it to the light, not to shrink from exposing it, to express it in
action and to impose it upon the world. The courage of self-affirmation
is the virtue which Unamuno exhorts his fellow-countrymen to achieve. He
presents a symbol of it in his vision of the Tower of Monterrey that
lifts itself into the wintry air above the brown roofs of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span> beloved
Salamanca, definite in its clean-cut contours, sure in its poise and
self-containment, serenely affirming its uniqueness and
indestructibility. It says itself, and to say himself is the utmost that
a man can say.</p>

<p>But society, which is the necessary medium through which the individual
must express himself, is a resistant medium. It seeks to impose
conformity upon the individual. It resents the exceptional, the
idiosyncratic. And the social canons that circumscribe the expression of
the individual’s liberty of thought and conduct operate perhaps nowhere
more oppressively than in Spain. They derive their sanction largely from
a sentiment by no means peculiar to Spain though perhaps peculiarly
rampant there, the sentiment of envy, the sense of bitterness and
hostility that is evoked by any salient excellence. And the chief weapon
which envy uses with which to assail the uniqueness of the individual is
ridicule. The special form, therefore, of the courage of
self-affirmation that is demanded of the heroic individual is the
courage to confront ridicule. This courage finds its exemplary exponent
in the figure of Don Quixote, whom Unamuno takes as the supreme symbol
of the warfare of the individual soul. His “Commentary upon the Life of
Don Quixote and Panza” is a clarion-call to his countrymen to emulate
the quixotic qualities of courage and faith&#8212;faith, even though it be in
illusion&#8212;the quixotic tenacity of conviction, and the quixotic contempt
of the standards of worldly prudence and of the authority of common
sense and the cold, mocking reason.</p>

<p>It must be claimed for Unamuno that he is, in the truest sense of the
word, a great humanist. He him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span>self distinguishes between the true
humanism, which he calls the humanism of man, and the humanism which is
concerned rather with “the things of man”&#8212;in other words, with culture
as it is generally understood. Towards the latter his attitude is
tinctured with suspicion. For him there is an element of the inhumane in
the cult of knowledge for the sake of knowledge and in the cult of
science as a mere cataloguing of existence. Culture must have reference
to character and perhaps its definition as “the best that is known and
has been thought in the world” he would feel to be incomplete without
the addition of “the best that has been felt and done.” But mere
knowledge and classification of the movements of the human mind or the
achievements of human energy do not necessarily of themselves touch the
heart to finer issues. The most urgent need, at any rate as he sees it
in his own country, is not so much for quickened intelligence as for
reawakened capacity for feeling and enthusiasm. By itself sceptical
enlightenment tends to paralyse action and the soil of a chilly
intellectualism is not the most fertile for the burgeoning of that seed
of faith from which all fruitful human endeavour must ultimately spring.
Unamuno seeks to generate warmth of feeling as the necessary condition
of high achievement. “Warmth, warmth, more warmth,” he cries, “for we
die of cold and not of darkness. It is not the night but the frost that
kills.” Culture, therefore, as he understands and counsels it, is not a
dry light but an ardent flame and its purpose is to kindle “the most
intense inner life, the life of intensest battle, of intensest
disquietude, of intensest despair.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Unamuno has always protested passionately against any attempt to affix a
label to him. If a definition of himself is demanded of him, he replies
that he is “a man of contradiction and strife.” The contradictions of
which he is the synthesis are those of the Catholic and the agnostic,
the mystic and the realist, the vitalist and the rationalist, the
contemplative and the man of action, the contradictions inherent in the
man who finds consolation in despair and peace in conflict. But if he
himself is not to be circumscribed within the narrow limits of a
definition, perhaps the scope of his aim and achievement may be most
succinctly resumed in that description which Giordano Bruno gave of
himself, <i>dormitantium animarum excubitor</i>&#8212;an awakener of sleeping
souls.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_SPIRIT_OF_CASTILE"></a>THE SPIRIT OF CASTILE</h2>

<p>From whatever point you penetrate into the Spanish peninsula, you will
find yourself confronted almost at once by a region of hills; you will
then enter into a labyrinth of valleys, gorges and ravines; and finally,
after a longer or shorter ascent, you will emerge upon the central
tableland, barred by the naked sierras whose wide and deep valleys form
the mighty cradles of mighty rivers. Across this tableland stretches
Castile, the land of castles.</p>

<p>Like all great expanses of earth, this tableland receives and irradiates
heat more quickly than the sea and the coast-lands which the sea
refreshes and tempers. Hence, when the sun scorches it, an extreme of
heat, and as soon as the sun forsakes it, an extreme of cold; burning
days of summer followed by cool fresh nights during which the lungs
gratefully inhale the breeze from the land; freezing winter nights
following hard upon days which the bright cold sun in its brief diurnal
course has failed to warm. Winters long and hard and summers short and
fiery have given birth to the saying, “<i>nueve meses de invierno y tres
de infierno</i>”&#8212;nine months of winter and three months of hell. In the
autumn, however, there is a serene and placid breathing-space. The
sierras, shutting out the winds from the sea, help to make the winter
colder and the summer hotter; but while they impede the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span> passage of the
gentle low-trailing clouds they form no barrier to the violent cyclones
which burst among their valleys. Thus long droughts are succeeded by
torrential deluges.</p>

<p>In this severe climate of opposing extremes, in which the transition
from heat to cold and from drought to flood is so violent, man has
invented the cloak with which to isolate himself from his environment, a
personal ambience, constant in the midst of external changes, a defence
at once against both heat and cold.</p>

<p>The great storms of rain and snow bursting upon these sierras and
drained thence by the swollen rivers have in the course of centuries
scoured the soil of the tableland, and the succeeding droughts have
prevented the retention of the rain-washed soil in a network of fresh
and robust vegetation. Thus it is that the view presents a wide and
desolate expanse of burning country, without foliage and without water,
a country in which a deluge of light throws dense shadows upon a
dazzling surface, extinguishing all intermediate tones. The landscape is
seen cut out in hard outline, almost without atmosphere, through a thin
and transparent air.</p>

<p>You may sometimes range over leagues and leagues of desert country
without descrying anything save the illimitable plain with its patches
of green corn or yellow stubble, here a sparsely extended array of oaks,
marching in solemn and monotonous procession, clothed in their austere
and perennial green, there a group of mournful pines, holding aloft
their uniform crests. Now and again, fringing a bright river or half-dry
stream, a few poplars, seeming intensely and vividly alive in the midst
of the infinite solitude. As a rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span> these poplars announce the presence
of man: yonder on the plain lies some village, scorched by the sun,
blasted by the frost, built of sun-baked bricks very often, its belfry
silhouetted against the blue of the sky. Often the spinal ridge of the
sierra can be seen in the distance, but if you approach it you must not
look to find rounded bossy mountains, fresh with verdure and clothed
with woods, with the yellow of the gorse and the carmine of the heather
flecking the bracken. Here is nothing but a framework of bony fleshless
rock, bristling with crags, sharp-cut hummocks nakedly displaying
drought-cracked strata, covered at most with a scanty scrub, where
flourish only the hardy thistle and the naked scented broom, the poor
<i>genestra contenta dei deserti</i> of Leopardi’s poem. Down in the plain
the highway with its festoon of trees loses itself in the greyness of
the earth, which kindles into an intense warm red when the sun sinks to
rest.</p>

<p>The setting of the sun in these immense solitudes is full of beauty. The
sun dilates as it touches the horizon as if greedy to enjoy still more
of the earth and in sinking it sheds its light upon it like blood and
fills the sky with a dust of gold. The infinite dome of the sky grows
paler and paler, then swiftly darkens, and the fleeting twilight is
followed by the profundity of a night tremulous with stars. Here are no
northern twilights, long, soft and languorous.</p>

<p>Broad is Castile! And beautiful with a sad quiet beauty this sea of
stone beneath its expanse of sky. It is a landscape uniform and
monotonous in its contrasts of light and shade, in its sharply
juxtaposed and unmodulated colours. It presents the appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span> an
immense floor of mosaic, without variety of design, above which is
spread out a sky of intensest blue. It is lacking in gentle transitions
and its only harmonic continuity is that of the immense plain and the
massed blue which overspreads and illumines it.</p>

<p>It is a landscape that awakens no voluptuous sensations of <i>joie de
vivre</i>, that inspires no longings for ease and idleness. Here are no
lush green meadows inviting indolent repose, no dells that beckon like
nests.</p>

<p>Its contemplation does not call forth the sleeping animal in us, the
animal that delights to drowse in a leafy paradise, brooding over the
remembered satisfactions of those appetites which have been kneaded into
the flesh since the earliest dawn of life.</p>

<p>Nature does not here recreate the spirit. Rather it detaches us from the
low earth and enfolds us in the pure naked unvarying sky. Here there is
no communion with nature, no absorption in her exuberant splendours.
This infinite landscape is, if it may be so said, nonotheistic rather
than pantheistic. Man is not lost in it so much as diminished by it, and
in its immense drought he is made aware of the aridity of his own soul.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The population of the Castilian country-side is concentrated for the
most part in hamlets, villages or towns, in groups of clustered
dwelling-houses, separated from one another by immense and naked
solitudes. The villages are compact and sharply delimited, not melting
away into the plain in a surrounding fringe of isolated homesteads, the
intervening country being entirely unpopulated. The houses seem to crowd
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span>gether round the church as if for warmth or for defence against the
rigour of nature, as if the inhabitants sought a second cloak in which
to isolate themselves from the cruelty of the climate and the melancholy
of the landscape. Thus it is that very often the villagers have to
journey considerable distances on mule-back in order to reach the fields
where they work, one here, another there, in isolation, and it is
already dark before they return to their homes to stretch themselves on
the hard kitchen settles and sleep the comforting sleep of toil. A
notable sight it is to see them at nightfall, mounted on their mules,
their figures silhouetted against the pale sky, their sad, slow,
monotonous songs dying away on the sharp night air into the infinity of
the furrowed plain.</p>

<p>While the men labour in the sweat of their brow on the hard land, the
womenfolk perform their tasks at home, filling the sunny arcades in
front of the houses with a murmur of voices. In the long winter evenings
it is usual for masters and serving-folk to assemble together, while the
latter dance to the accompaniment of the sharp dry tap of the tambourine
or sometimes to an old ballad measure.</p>

<p>Go into one of these villages or drowsing cities of the plain, where
life flows slowly and calmly in a monotonous procession of hours, and
there you will find the living souls beneath whose transitory existence
lies the eternal essence out of which is woven the inner history of
Castile.</p>

<p>Within these towns and villages lives a breed of men of a dry, hard and
sinewy constitution, burned by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_35">{35}</a></span> the sun and inured by the cold, a sober,
frugal breed, the product of a long process of natural selection by
searching winter frosts and intermittent periods of scarcity, tempered
to withstand the inclemency of the skies and the asperities of penury.
The peasant who gave you a grave “Good day” as he passed by on his mule,
huddled in his cloak, will receive you without overmuch courtesy, with a
kind of restrained sobriety. He is collected in his movements,
circumspect and deliberate in his conversation, with a gravity which
gives him the air of a dethroned king. Such at any rate he appears when
he is not cunningly ironical. This sly biting irony&#8212;<i>socarronería</i>, a
racy word full of racy character&#8212;is the classical form of Castilian
humour, a quiet and circumspect humour, sententious and phlegmatic, the
humour of Sanson Carrasco in <i>Don Quixote</i> and of Quevedo, he who wrote
the discourses of Marcus Brutus.</p>

<p>His slowness is matched by his tenacity, qualities that have an intimate
association. His reaction-interval, as the psycho-physiologists would
express it, is long; it takes him a considerable time to realize an
impression or an idea, but once he has grasped it he does not readily
relinquish it, does not in fact relinquish it until another has impinged
upon it and driven it out. The slowness and tenacity of his impressions
would appear to be due to the lack of an environing and unifying nimbus,
blending them into a conjunctive whole; they do not merge into one
another by subtle gradations, but each one disappears completely before
the next takes its place. They seem to follow one an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span>other like the
succession of uniform and monotonous tones in the landscape of his
country, sharp edge against sharp edge.</p>

<p>Go with him into his house. On the front wall the violent contrast of
strident blue paint against a snow-white background exposed to the full
blaze of the sun is almost painful to the eye. Sit down to table with
him and partake of his simple dinner, prepared without much culinary
art, accompanied only by keen and fiery condiments, a meal that is at
once both frugal and violent, providing the palate with sharp-edged
sensations. After the dinner, if the day chances to be a holiday, you
will witness a dance, a dance slow and uniform, danced to the monotonous
beat of drum or tambourine, a series of stabbing sounds that strike upon
the ear like blows. And you will hear songs, wailing and monotonous,
full of long-drawn-out notes, songs of the steppes, with the rhythm of
the dragging labour of the plough in them. They testify to an ear that
is incapable of appreciating the finer gradations of cadences and
semi-tones.</p>

<p>If you are in a town and there are any pictures there of the old
traditional school of Castile, go to see them&#8212;for in the great days of
its expansion this race created a school of realistic painting, of a
rude, vigorous, simplified realism, very limited in range of tone, which
has the effect of a violent douche upon the vision. Perhaps you will
come across some canvas of Ribera or Zurbaran&#8212;your eye is held by the
bony form of some austere hermit, whose sinewy muscles are presented in
high light against strong shadows, a canvas meagre in tones and
gradations, in which every object<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_37">{37}</a></span> stands out sharp-edged. Not
infrequently the figures fail to form a single whole with the
background, which is a mere accessory of insignificant decorative value.
Velazquez, who of all Castilian painters possesses most of the racial
character, was a painter of men, of whole men, men all of one piece,
rude and emphatic, men who fill the whole canvas.</p>

<p>You will find no landscape-painters, you will discover no sense of tone,
of suave transition, no unifying, enveloping atmosphere, which blends
everything into a single harmonious whole. The unity springs from the
more or less architectonic disposition of the several parts.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>In this country of climatic extremes, without any softness or mildness,
of a landscape uniform in its contrasts, the spirit likewise is dry and
sharp-edged, with but a meagre ambience of ideas. It generalises upon
raw facts, seen in a discrete series, as in a kaleidoscope, not upon a
synthesis or analysis of facts seen in a continuous series, in a living
stream; it sees them sharp-edged like figures in the Castilian landscape
and it takes them as they appear, in their own dress, without
reconstructing them. And it has given birth to a harsh popular realism
and to a dry formal idealism, marching alongside one another, in an
association like that of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, but never
combining. The Castilian spirit is either ironic or tragic, sometimes
both at once, but it never arrives at a fusion of the irony and the
austere tragedy of the human drama.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="SPANISH_INDIVIDUALISM"></a>SPANISH INDIVIDUALISM</h2>

<p>In few books have I found so much food for reflection upon our Spain and
us Spaniards as in Martin A. S. Hume’s “The Spanish People: Their
Origin, Growth and Influence.” It is written by one who knows and
esteems us. It impresses us at a first glance as an excellent compendium
of the history of Spain, but on closer examination it is found to be
also an excellent psychological study of the Spanish people.</p>

<p>In the tenth chapter there is to be noted a very happy and graphic
phrase&#8212;“the introspective individuality of Spaniards.” And it is indeed
true that we are much given to this direct contemplation of ourselves, a
practice which is certainly not the best method of getting to know
ourselves, of fulfilling the precept “Know thyself” in its collective
and social sense. Introspection is very deceptive and when carried to an
extreme produces an actual vacuity of consciousness, like that into
which the Yogi falls through perpetual contemplation of his own navel.
For a state of consciousness which consisted purely and simply of
consciousness contemplating itself would not be a state of consciousness
at all, being void of all content. This supposed reflection of the soul
upon its own self is an absurdity. To think that one thinks without
thinking of anything concrete is mere negation. We learn to know
ourselves in the same way that we learn to know others, by observing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">{39}</a></span>
our actions, and the only difference is that, as we are always with
ourselves and scarcely anything that we consciously do escapes us, we
have more data for knowing ourselves than we have for knowing others.
But even so, we seldom know all that we are capable of until we put
ourselves to it, and often we surprise ourselves by achieving something
which we did not expect of ourselves.</p>

<p>Hence the utility of a people knowing its own history in order that it
may know itself. And Hume studies us in our history.</p>

<p>In one of his books the American humorist, Oliver Wendell Holmes, speaks
of the three Johns: the John as he himself thinks he is, the John as
others think he is, and the John as he is in reality. And as for every
individual, so for every people there are three Johns. There is the
Spanish people as we Spaniards believe it to be, there is the Spanish
people as foreigners believe it to be, and there is the Spanish people
as it really is. It is difficult to say which of the first two
approximates most nearly to the last; but it is certainly right that we
should compare them together and see ourselves both from within and from
without. However much we may lament the injustice or the superficiality
of the judgments that our foreign visitors pronounce upon us, it is
possible that we are no less unjust or superficial in our own judgment
of ourselves.</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis, in a book published not long ago, “The Soul of Spain,”
spoke of the unity of our race. Spaniards have generally regarded this
view as absurd, but it may very well be that the differences that
sep<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_40">{40}</a></span>arate the inhabitants of the various provinces of Spain are no
greater than those which exist between the inhabitants of the different
districts of other nations which we suppose to be more unified than
ourselves, and that our lack of solidarity, our separatist instinct, our
<i>kabylism</i>, as it is called, proceeds from other causes than from
differences of race. Little notice need be taken of certain ethnological
assertions, not so much based upon scientific investigation as inspired
by sentiments which, whether creditable or not, furnish no basis for
arriving at the truth. Thus, if a writer asserts that the Catalans are
Aryans and all other Spaniards Semites, it is obvious that he is using
the terms Aryan and Semite without a proper understanding of them; and
as the distinction between Catalans and other Spaniards is one of
philology rather than ethnology, it would be interesting to know what
language the ancestors of the present Catalans spoke before Latin
penetrated into Cataluña, for the supposition that they are descended
from Greek colonists is too nonsensical to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Before proceeding further in this review of Hume’s study of the
psychology of the Spanish people, I should like to indicate a
distinction which I am in the habit of making between individuality and
personality, a distinction which appears to me to be of great
importance.</p>

<p>All my readers know what is meant by “individual” or “indivisible,” a
unity that is distinct from other unities and not divisible into unities
analogous to it; and also what is meant by a person. The notion of
person refers rather to the spiritual content, and that of in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_41">{41}</a></span>dividual
to the containing limit. Great individuality, that which separates an
individual strongly and emphatically from other analogous individuals,
may have very little that is peculiar and personal to itself. It might
even be said that individuality and personality are in a certain sense
opposed to one another, although in another wider and more exact sense
it may be said that they afford one another mutual support. Strong
individuality is scarcely possible without a respectable dose of
personality, neither is a strong and rich personality possible without a
considerable degree of individuality to hold its various elements
together; but the vigour of a vigorous individuality may very easily
contain only the minimum of personality and the richness of a rich
personality may be contained within the minimum of individuality.</p>

<p>I will endeavour, as is my wont, to make my meaning clearer by means of
metaphors.</p>

<p>In gases, according to the physicists, the molecules are in a certain
state of disassociation, moving rectilinearly in all directions&#8212;it is
this which produces the phenomena of expansion&#8212;a state that is chaotic
but not in reality very complex; and it is a well-known fact that very
complex bodies are not as a rule found in a gaseous state, but only
those that are simplest and least complicated. In solids, on the other
hand, the molecules are ordered according to relatively fixed orbits and
trajectories&#8212;especially in the case of crystals; and their
individuality is maintained by a principle of intense cohesion, their
surfaces being in direct contact with their environment, capable of
affecting it and being affected by it. A middle term is pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span>sented by
liquids. And thus we may compare certain strongly individualized natures
with gases enclosed in a bottle or shell with rigid sides, while there
are others, with flexible contours, in a free give-and-take contact with
their environment, which possess great internal complexity&#8212;in other
words, a high degree of personality.</p>

<p>Or we may compare the former with crustaceans, enclosed in hard shells
which give them rigid and permanent forms, and the latter with
vertebrates, which, since they carry their skeleton within themselves,
are capable of considerable external modification.</p>

<p>Individuality refers rather to our external limits, it exhibits our
finiteness; personality refers principally to our internal limits, or
rather to our inward unlimitedness, it exhibits our infinitude.</p>

<p>All this is somewhat tenuous and perhaps fails to meet the demands of
strict psychology, but it is enough if it has helped to make my meaning
clearer.</p>

<p>My idea is that the Spaniard possesses, as a general rule, more
individuality than personality; that the vigour with which he affirms
himself before others and the energy with which he creates dogmas and
locks himself up in them, do not correspond with any richness of inward
spiritual content, which in his case rarely errs on the side of
complexity.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>In his preface Hume states that the Spaniards spring from an
Afro-Semitic race, that “the keynote of this primitive racial character
is overwhelming individuality,” and that to this root-cause is to be
attributed all that we have accomplished in the world, our transient<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span>
imperial greatness and our permanent tenacity. This feeling of
individuality lies deep down in the root of the race and cunning
politicians have turned it to the advantage of their ambitions.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Arab domination he says that “the Berber, like his
far-away relative the Iberian, was a man of strong individuality, with
an obstinate reluctance to obey another unless he spoke in the name of a
supernatural entity.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ninth chapter in which he treats of our epoch
of greatness in the middle of the 16th century, he writes the following
notable lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Each unlettered boor and swaggering soldier felt in an undefined
way that he was a creature apart by reason of his faith; that
Spaniards and the Spaniards’ king had a higher mission than was
accorded to other men; and that from among the eight million
Spaniards alive the particular Juan or Pedro in question stood out
individually, in the sight of God and men, as pre-eminently the
most zealous and orthodox of them all. To this had the policy of
Fernando and Isabel brought the mass of the Spanish people.”</p></div>

<p>And in corroboration of this he draws a striking portrait of Philip II,
the idol of our traditionalists:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Intense individuality in him, as in so many of his countrymen, was
merged in the idea of personal distinction in the eyes of God by
self-sacrifice.... At heart he was kindly, a good father and
husband, an indulgent and considerate master, having no love for
cruelty itself. And yet lying, dishonesty, cruelty, the infliction
of suffering and death upon hosts of helpless ones, and the secret
murder of those who stood in his path, were not wrong for <i>him</i>,
be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_44">{44}</a></span>cause, in his moral obliquity he thought that the ends justified
the means, and that all was lawful in the linked causes of God and
Spain.” “He was blind and oblivious to all but the blood-boltered
Christ, before whom he writhed in a maniacal agony of devotion,
sure in his dark soul, as were so many of his countrymen, that the
divine finger pointed from glory alone upon him as the one chosen
man who was to enforce upon earth the rule of the Most High,
with&#8212;as a necessary consequence&#8212;Philip of Spain as his
viceregent.”</p></div>

<p>I know that many who look upon this portrait will come forward with the
familiar objection that this Philip II is the Devil of the South of the
Protestant legend, and will advance the counter-legend&#8212;equally
legendary&#8212;which is being built up out of a mass of minute data by
historians who combine the method of Dr. Dryasdust with the spirit of
rabid partisanship.</p>

<p>What interests me in Hume’s description is his statement that every
Spaniard regards himself as an individual apart, specially and
personally chosen by God. This recalls Pascal’s claim that Jesus Christ
in dying shed a drop of blood for him, Blaise Pascal, who was destined
to live in France in the middle of the 17th century. There is a certain
characteristic common to all those whom we call geniuses or great men
and other heroes. Each of them has a consciousness of being a man apart,
chosen very expressly by God for the performance of a certain work.</p>

<p>In this respect we Spaniards are inclined to think ourselves geniuses,
or rather we have a very robust conception of the Divinity&#8212;we think of
Him not as the frigid and exalted God of the French Deism of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_45">{45}</a></span> 18th
century, nor yet as the good-natured and easy-going God of good people
that Béranger depicts, but rather as a God whose attention and care
extends to the very last ant, regarded as a separate individual, as well
as to the very greatest and most splendid of suns.</p>

<p>In actual fact all these claims to singularity and to being one apart
from the rest may become reprehensible, but it is at least
understandable that an orator, for example, or a writer, or a singer,
should regard himself as the best orator, the best writer, or the best
singer. What is not understandable is that a man who is neither orator,
writer, painter, sculptor, musician, nor man of business, that a man who
does nothing at all, should expect by the mere fact of his presence to
be reputed a man of extraordinary merit and exceptional talent. And
nevertheless here in Spain&#8212;I do not know how it may be elsewhere&#8212;there
are many examples of this curious phenomenon.</p>

<p>I know of the man who is ready to admit that others may be handsomer,
smarter, stronger, healthier, wiser, more intelligent, more generous,
than he, that in each and all of their endowments they have the
advantage over him; but nevertheless he, Juan Lopez, the individual in
question, is superior to everyone else just because he is Juan Lopez,
because there is no other Juan Lopez exactly like him and because it is
impossible that all the qualities, good, bad and indifferent, that make
him him, Juan Lopez, should ever be assembled together again. He is a
unique individual, he cannot be substituted by anyone else&#8212;and he is in
a measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">{46}</a></span> right in thinking so. He can say with <i>Obermann</i>: “In the
universe I am nothing; for myself I am everything.”</p>

<p>This violent individualism, combined with very meagre personalism, with
a great lack of personality, is a factor that explains a great deal of
our history. It explains that intense thirst for individual immortality
which consumes the Spaniard, a thirst that lies hidden beneath what is
called our cult of death. Homage to this cult of death is rendered no
less by the most furious lovers of life, by those in whom the joy of
living is unable to extinguish the hunger for survival. It appears to me
a very great error to assert that the Spaniard does not love life
because he finds life hard. On the contrary, it is because his life is
hard that he has not arrived at the <i>tædium vitæ</i>, the <i>Weltschmerz</i> of
the satiated, and that he has always aimed at prolonging it indefinitely
beyond death.</p>

<p>In the third part of the “Ethics” of Spinoza, a Jew of Spanish
origin&#8212;or Portuguese, which amounts to the same thing&#8212;there are four
admirable propositions, the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, in which
he lays it down that everything, in so far as it is in itself,
endeavours to persist in its own being; that the endeavour wherewith a
thing endeavours to persist in its being is nothing else than the actual
essence of that thing (<i>conatus, quo unaquæque res in suo esse
perseverare conatur, nihil est præter ipsius rei actualem essentiam</i>);
that this effort or endeavour involves no finite time but an indefinite
time, and that the spirit endeavours to persist in its being for an
indefinite period and is conscious of this its endeavour. It is not
possible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_47">{47}</a></span> express with more precision the longing for immortality
that consumes the soul.</p>

<p>This strong individualism, the individualism of an individual who
endeavours to persist, has led the Spaniard to follow always the path of
conduct and will, and this is the reason of Schopenhauer’s admiration of
Spaniards, whom he deemed to be one of the peoples most fully possessed
of will&#8212;or rather of wilfulness&#8212;most tenacious of life. Our
indifference to life is only on the surface and really conceals a most
dogged attachment to it. And this practical tendency is manifest in our
thought, which ever since Seneca has inclined to what is called moralism
and has evinced but little interest in pure metaphysical and speculative
contemplation, in viewing the world as a spectator.</p>

<p>It is this imperious individualism that has led us to the dogmatism that
corrodes us. Spain is the country of those who are more papistical than
the Pope, as the saying is. Spain is the chosen and most propitious soil
for what is called <i>integrism</i>, which is the triumph of the maximum of
individuality compatible with the minimum of personality. Spain was, in
short, and in more than one respect continues to be, the land of the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>Of the Inquisition and inquisitorialism, Hume writes very aptly. “Innate
cruelty, individual pride, a vivid imagination long fed with extravagant
fables, religious and secular, and lust for unearned wealth, all
combined under the eager blessings of the Queen [Isabel] and the Church
to make the Spaniards, as a race, relentless persecutors of those who
dared to think differently from themselves.” Beneath the manifest and
not inconsid<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span>erable exaggeration, there is here a large basis of truth.
Spaniards could do no wrong “because they were working for and with the
cause of God.” “The bureaucratic unity of the Romans was no longer
possible [in the time of Fernando and Isabel], for out of the reconquest
had grown separate nations; but at least the various peoples, the
autonomous dominions, the semi-independent towns, might be held together
by the strong bond of religious unity; and with this object the
Inquisition was established, as a governmental system, to be developed
later into a political engine.... Thus it is that Spain appears for the
first time in the concert of modern European nations a power whose very
existence in a concrete form depends upon its rigid doctrinal
Catholicism.” This last assertion appears to me so doubtful and I am so
far from believing it to be just that I shall have to devote a special
study to its refutation.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>This Spanish individualism has undoubtedly been the cause of another
characteristic feature of our history, a feature to which Hume pays very
particular attention. It is known as <i>cantonalism</i> or <i>kabylism</i>. I
refer of course to our tendency to disruption, to separate into tribes.
Hume alludes to it at the beginning of his history in the following
notable lines: “In any case, what is known of their physique seems to
negative the supposition that they [the Iberians] were of Indo-European
or Aryan origin; and to find their counterpart at the present time, it
is only necessary to seek the Kabyl tribes of the Atlas, the original
inhabitants of the African coast opposite Spain, who were driven<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span> back
into the mountains by successive waves of invasion. Not alone in
physique do these tribes resemble what the early Iberian must have been,
but in the more unchanging peculiarities of character and institutions
the likeness is easily traceable to the Spaniard of to-day. The
organization of the Iberians, like that of the Atlas peoples, was
clannish and tribal, and their chief characteristic was their
indomitable local independence. Warlike and brave, sober and
light-hearted, the Kabyl tribesman has for thousands of years stubbornly
resisted all attempts to weld him into a nation or subject him to a
uniform dominion, while the Iberian, starting probably from the same
stock, was blended with Aryan races possessing other qualities, and was
submitted for six centuries to the unifying organization of the greatest
governing race the world ever saw&#8212;the Romans; yet, withal, even at the
present day, the main characteristics of the Spanish nation, like that
of the Kabyl tribes, is lack of solidarity.”</p>

<p>This fundamental idea appears all through Hume’s book like a refrain or
<i>leitmotiv</i>.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Out of all this, two questions now emerge: the first, what is the origin
of this individualism? and the second, what is its cure?&#8212;the one
ethnological, the other therapeutical.</p>

<p>As I indicated at the beginning, in quoting the opinion of Havelock
Ellis, I am not at all disposed to believe that <i>kabylism</i> or
<i>cantonalism</i>, the separatist tendency, proceeds from differences of
race. If Cataluña or the Basque provinces could be forthwith removed and
isolated in the middle of the Atlantic, we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_50">{50}</a></span> very soon see them
torn by internal dissensions, by separatist tendencies, and conflicts
for supremacy would arise between the various dialects of the Catalan
and Basque languages. In the Basque provinces such internal dissensions
are beginning to be patent even to the least acute observer.</p>

<p>There is one capital sin that is very peculiarly Spanish, and that sin
is envy. It is a result of our peculiar individualism, and it is one of
the causes of <i>kabylism</i>. Envy has crippled and still cripples not a few
of the best minds of Spain, minds that are in other respects vigorous
and exuberant. We are all familiar with the famous simile of the greasy
pole. Deep down in our racial character there is a certain sediment of
spiritual avarice, of lack of generosity of soul, a certain propensity
to consider ourselves rich only in so far as others are poor, and this
sediment requires to be purged away.</p>

<p>Spanish <i>kabylism</i> and individualism both appear to me to be effects of
one and the same cause, the cause that also produced <i>picarism</i>. In his
book entitled <i>Hampa</i>, Salillas showed very clearly how the poverty of
the soil, its failure to serve as a basis for the support of the people,
was responsible for the seasonal migration of flocks and herds together
with the vagabond life that resulted therefrom. It appears to me more
concrete and more historical to say that it obliged the Iberians to be
herdsmen. Hume expresses it exactly when he says that the pure Spaniard
has always been “an agriculturist by necessity and a shepherd by choice,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The spectators, so far from encouraging or applauding the
competitors, are said to pull them back and generally hinder them
from securing the prize.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">when he was not a soldier.” I believe that a consideration of this
pastoral character of our people would help to explain a great deal of
our history and to modify accepted verdicts. At bottom the expulsion of
the Moriscos, an industrious people of agriculturists and gardeners,
appears to me to have been due to the traditional hatred which those
whom I will call Abelites, the spiritual descendants of Abel, the keeper
of flocks, bore towards the descendants of Cain, the tiller of the
ground, who killed his brother. For the Hebrew legend of Cain and Abel
presents one of the most profound intuitions of the beginnings of human
history.</p>

<p>And what is the cure for this individualism? The first thing is to see
whether it is an evil, and if it appears to be one, to see if it may not
be converted into a good, for it is evident that vices and virtues
proceed from the same stock and a single passion may be turned either to
good or to evil.</p>

<p>The exigences of life in past ages made our remote ancestors herdsmen;
being herdsmen, they acquired all the qualities that pastoral life tends
to develop&#8212;they were idlers, they were wanderers, and they were
disunited. The lapse of time, civilized and urban life, the necessities
imposed by industrial and commercial competition&#8212;progress, in
short&#8212;will modify this basal character. Can this process be
accelerated, and by what means?&#8212;But that is another question.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_52">{52}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="SOME_ARBITRARY_REFLECTIONS_UPON_EUROPEANIZATION"></a>SOME ARBITRARY REFLECTIONS UPON EUROPEANIZATION</h2>

<p>It is a not unprofitable task to examine the national consciousness by
examining ourselves and to ask ourselves as Spaniards what there is of
intrinsic and permanent worth in most of these schemes for our national
regeneration which almost all of us are discussing nowadays, some more
insistently than others.</p>

<p>All those things which are being demanded and which almost all of us
have demanded on behalf of our people, with a greater or less degree of
comprehension of what these demands mean, may be summed up in two
terms&#8212;<i>European</i> and <i>modern</i>. “We must be modern,” “we must be
European,” “we must modernize ourselves,” “we must go with the century,”
“we must Europeanize ourselves”&#8212;such are the watchwords of the hour.</p>

<p>The term <i>European</i> expresses a vague idea, very vague, excessively
vague; but much vaguer is the idea that is expressed by the term
<i>modern</i>. If we combine the two together it would seem that they ought
to limit one another and result in something concrete, and that the
expression “modern European” ought to be clearer than either of its two
component terms; but perhaps it is really vaguer still.</p>

<p>It will be apparent that I am proceeding by way of what some would call
arbitrary statement, without doc<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span>umentation, without verification,
independent of modern European logic and disdainful of its methods.
Perhaps. I seek no other method than the method of passion; and when I
am moved with disgust, with repugnance, with pity or with contempt, I
let the mouth speak from the fullness of the heart and the words come
forth as they will.</p>

<p>We Spaniards, so they say, are arbitrary charlatans, we fill up the
broken links of logic with rhetoric, we subtilize skilfully but
uselessly, we lack the sense of consecutiveness and induction, we have
scholastic minds, we are casuists ... etc., etc.</p>

<p>I have heard similar things said of St. Augustine, the great African,
the fiery soul that overflowed in waves of rhetoric, in phraseological
contortions, in antitheses, in paradoxes and conceits. St. Augustine was
at once a gongorist and a conceptist. Which leads me to believe that
Gongorism and conceptism are the natural forms of passion and vehemence.</p>

<p>The great African, the great ancient African! Here you have an
expression, “ancient African,” which can be opposed to that of “modern
European,” and which is at least of equal value. St. Augustine was
African and he was of the ancient world; so also was Tertullian. And why
should we not say: “We must Africanize ourselves ancientwise” or “We
must ancientize ourselves Africanwise”?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Luis de Gongora (1561-1627) elaborated an affected and euphuistic
style of composition. Conception is the name given to the
employment of <i>conceptos</i>, a characteristic Spanish form of
conceits. It is exemplified in the writings of Quevedo (1580-1645)
and its subtleties were reduced to an exact code by Baltasar
Gracián in his <i>Agudeza y arte de ingenio</i> (1642).</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span></p>

<p>Turning my glance inwards upon myself after the lapse of years, after
having wandered among the various fields of modern European culture, I
ask myself, face to face with my conscience: Am I European? am I modern?
And my conscience replies: No, you are not European, not what is called
European; no, you are not modern, not what is called modern. And I ask
myself again: Is the fact that you feel that you are neither European
nor modern due to the fact that you are a Spaniard? Are we Spaniards, at
heart, irreducible to Europeanization and modernization? And if that be
the case, is there no salvation for us? Is there no other life than
modern and European life? Is there no other culture&#8212;or whatever you
like to call it?</p>

<p>First of all, so far as I myself am concerned, I must confess that the
more I reflect upon it, the more I become aware of the inner repugnance
that my spirit feels for all those that are considered to be the guiding
principles of the modern European spirit, for the scientific orthodoxy
of to-day, for its methods, for its tendencies.</p>

<p>There are two things that are often talked about&#8212;science and life. And
I must confess that both the one and the other are antipathetic to me.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to define science, or Science, if you like, with the
capital letter, this thing which is now being so widely popularized, the
purpose of which is to give us a more logical and exact idea of the
Universe. When I used to be something of a Spencerian I believed myself
to be enamoured of science; but afterwards I discovered that this was a
mistake. It was a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span> like the mistake of those who think that they
are happy when they are not. (It is evident that I reject, arbitrarily
of course, the idea that being happy consists in thinking that one is
happy.) No, I was never enamoured of science, I always sought for
something behind it. And when, endeavouring to get beyond its fatidical
relativity, I was led to the <i>ignorabimus</i> position, I realized that
science had always irked me.</p>

<p>And what are you going to put in its place? I shall be asked. I might
say ignorance, but that is not certain. I might say, with the Preacher,
the son of David, king of Jerusalem, that he who increases knowledge
increases sorrow and that the same end awaits the wise man and the fool;
but no, it is not that. I don’t need to invent a word, however, to
express what it is that I oppose to science, for the word exists, and it
is <i>sabiduría</i>&#8212;the <i>sagesse</i> of the French, the <i>wisdom</i> of the
English, the German <i>Weisheit</i> or <i>Klugheit</i>. But is it opposed to
science? I shall be asked. And I, following my arbitrary method, guided
by the passion of my spirit, by my innate aversions and my innate
attractions, reply: Yes, they are opposed; science robs men of wisdom
and usually converts them into phantom beings loaded up with facts.</p>

<p>The other thing that is being incessantly talked about to-day is life,
and to this it is easy to find an opposite. The opposite to life is
death.</p>

<p>And this second opposition helps me to explain the first. Wisdom is to
science what death is to life, or, if you prefer it, wisdom is to death
what science is to life.</p>

<p>The object of science is life, and the object of wis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span>dom is death.
Science says: “We must live,” and seeks the means of prolonging,
increasing, facilitating and amplifying life, of making it tolerable and
acceptable; wisdom says: “We must die,” and seeks how to make us die
well.</p>

<p><i>Homo liber de nulla re minus quam de morte cogitat, et eius sapientia
non mortis, sed vita meditatio est</i>&#8212;so Spinoza announces in Proposition
LXVII of the fourth part of his “Ethics”: The free man thinks of nothing
less than of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of
life.</p>

<p>In this case, this wisdom, this <i>sapientia</i>, is no longer wisdom, but
science. And it is also necessary to inquire what kind of man is meant
by this “free man.” The man free from the supreme anguish, free from the
eternal heartache, free from the gaze of the Sphinx, that is to say, the
man who is not a man, the ideal of the modern European.</p>

<p>And here we have another concept which is as little sympathetic to me as
those of life and science, the concept of liberty. There is no other
true liberty than the liberty of death.</p>

<p>And what is at the bottom of all this? What are they seeking and
pursuing, those who grasp at science and life and liberty, turning their
backs, whether they are aware of it or not, upon wisdom and death? What
they are seeking is happiness.</p>

<p>I believe&#8212;perhaps this belief of mine is also arbitrary&#8212;I believe that
here we touch the bottom of our inquiry. The so-called modern European
comes to the world to seek happiness for himself and for others, and
believes that man ought to succeed in being happy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">{57}</a></span> And this is a
supposition to which I am unable to conform. And now, as I am confessing
myself, I am going to put before you an arbitrary dilemma&#8212;arbitrary,
because I cannot prove it to you logically, because it is imposed upon
me by the feeling of my heart, not by the reasoning of my head: either
happiness or love. If you want the one, you must renounce the other.
Love kills happiness, happiness kills love.</p>

<p>And here it would be very apposite to adduce all that our mystics, our
admirable mystics, our only classic philosophers, the creators of our
Spanish wisdom, not our Spanish science&#8212;perhaps the terms “science” and
“Spanish” are, happily, mutually repellent&#8212;have felt, felt rather than
thought, about love and happiness&#8212;the <i>muero porque no muero</i> and the
<i>dolor sabroso</i> and all the rest that emanates from the same depths of
feeling.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>And what relation does all this bear to the spiritual problem of Spain?
Is it anything more than a purely and exclusively personal, that is to
say arbitrary, position? Is it as a Spaniard that I feel all this? Is it
suggested to me by the Spanish soul?</p>

<p>It has been said that with the Catholic Kings and the beginnings of
national unity the course of our history was turned into another
channel. It is certain that since then, with the discovery of America
and our intermeddling in European affairs, we have been drawn into the
current of other peoples. Spain entered into the strong current of the
Renaissance and our mediæval soul began to be obliterated. And the
Renaissance was in its essence just this: science, above all in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_58">{58}</a></span>
form of humanities, and life. And thought dwelt less upon death and the
mystical wisdom gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>It has frequently been said that the Spaniard is too much preoccupied
with death; and we have been told, in a variety of ways and especially
by those who deal in platitudes, that the preoccupation with death
prevents us from living like moderns and like Europeans. The blame even
for our death-rate and for our squalor and for our lack of health has
been thrown upon our so-called cult of death. And it seems to me, on the
other hand, that we think too little about death, or rather that we only
half think about it.</p>

<p>And we half think and half meditate about death because we pretend to be
European and modern without ceasing to be Spaniards, and that is
impossible. And we have made an infamous commixture of our classic
wisdom and exotic science, of our innate deep feeling for death and a
borrowed solicitude for life. And we have thought we were keenly
interested in progress whereas in fact we trouble very little about it.</p>

<p>“You deceive yourself,” a foreign friend of mine once said to me,
thinking that although I was a Spaniard I was also European and modern,
“you deceive yourself&#8212;Spaniards in general are incapable of
civilization and refractory to it.”</p>

<p>And I left him cold with stupor when I replied: “And is that a fault?”
The man looked at me as one looks at someone who has suddenly gone mad;
it must have seemed to him as if I had denied a postulate of geometry.
He began to reason with me and I said: “No, don’t attempt to give me
reasons. I think I may<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span> say without boasting, and yet without the
hypocrisy of modesty, that I know all the reasons you can bring forward
on this point. It is not a question of reasons but of feelings.”</p>

<p>He insisted, attempting to talk to me about feeling, and I added: “No,
my friend, no, you know all about logic, but it is not logic, but
passion, that governs feelings.” And I left him and went away to read
the confessions of the great African of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Is it not perhaps true that we Spaniards are, in effect, spiritually
refractory to what is called modern European culture? And if this be so,
ought we to be distressed about it? Is it not possible to live and to
die, above all to die well, without this fortunate culture?</p>

<p>And by this I don’t mean that we are engulfed in inaction, in ignorance
and in barbarism&#8212;no, not that. There are means of augmenting the
spirit, of exalting it, of enlarging it, of ennobling it, of making it
more divine, without having recourse to this same culture. We can, I
believe, cultivate our wisdom without accepting science except as a
means to this end, taking due precautions against its corrupting the
spirit.</p>

<p>Just as love of death and the feeling that it is the principle of our
true life ought not to lead us to a violent renunciation of life, to
suicide&#8212;for life is a preparation for death, and the better the
preparation, the better the thing prepared for&#8212;so neither ought love of
wisdom to lead us to a renunciation of science, for that would be
equivalent to mental suicide, but to an acceptance of science as a
preparation, and as nothing more than a preparation, for wisdom.</p>

<p>For my part I can say that if I had never made<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_60">{60}</a></span> excursions into the
fields of some of the modern European sciences, I should never have
taken the delight that I have taken in our ancient African wisdom, in
our popular wisdom, in what scandalizes all the Pharisees and Sadducees
of intellectualism, that horrible intellectualism that poisons the soul.
It is hearing hymns in praise of them that has made me view science and
life with distrust, perhaps with horror, and love the wisdom of death,
the meditation which, according to Spinoza, the free man, that is, the
happy man, does not meditate.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>A few days ago I read an article by my friend and fellow-Basque, Pío
Baroja, entitled “The Sad Country,” in which he says that Spain is a sad
country, just as France is a beautiful country. He opposes smiling
France, with its level fertile soil, with its mild climate, with its
bright transparent rivers that slide smoothly along flush with their
banks, to our peninsula, full of stones, burnt by the sun and frozen
with the winter frost. He observes that in France the products of the
spirit cannot compare with the products of agriculture and industry;
that the dramas of Racine are not fashioned so finely as the wines of
Bordeaux; that the pictures of Delacroix are not so good as the oysters
of Arcachon; and that, on the other hand, our great men, Cervantes,
Velazquez, El Greco, Goya, are the equals or more than the equals of the
great men of any other country; while our actual life is not equal to,
not the life of Morocco, but the life of Portugal.</p>

<p>And I say: Is it not worth while to undergo the hardship of renouncing
this pleasant life of France in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">{61}</a></span> order to breathe the spirit that can
produce a Cervantes, a Velazquez, an El Greco, a Goya? Are not these
perhaps incompatible with the wine of Bordeaux and the oysters of
Arcachon? I believe&#8212;arbitrarily of course&#8212;that it is so, that they are
incompatible, and I take my stand with <i>Don Quixote</i>, with Velazquez,
with El Greco, with Goya, and against the wine of Bordeaux and the
oysters of Arcachon, against Racine and Delacroix. Passion and
sensuality are incompatible; passion is arbitrary, logic is sensual. For
logic is nothing but a form of sensuality.</p>

<p>“All our material and intellectual products are hard, rugged and
disagreeable,” Baroja continues. “The wine is thick, the meat bad, the
papers boring and the literature sad. I don’t know what it is that makes
our literature so disagreeable.”</p>

<p>Here I must pause. I am not sensible of this identification of the sad
with the disagreeable; and I will even say&#8212;although there may be some
simple enough to take this to be a paradox&#8212;that for me the disagreeable
is that which is called gay. I shall never forget the highly
disagreeable effect, the deep disgust, which the strident hilarity of
the Parisian boulevard produced upon me seventeen years ago, and the
feeling of disquiet and uneasiness that came over me there. All that
world of youth, dancing, jesting, playing, drinking, making love, seemed
to me to be composed of puppets endowed with sense; they seemed to lack
consciousness, to be appearances merely. I felt alone, utterly alone
among them, and this feeling of loneliness pained me. I could not bring
myself to accept the idea that these roisterers, these devotees of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span>
<i>joie de vivre</i>, were beings like myself, my fellows, or even the idea
that they were living creatures dowered with consciousness.</p>

<p>Here you have an instance of the way in which gaiety jarred upon me, was
disagreeable to me. And on the other hand, when I am in the midst of
heart-sick multitudes crying to heaven for mercy, chanting a <i>De
profundis</i> or a <i>Miserere</i>, I cannot help feeling myself among brothers,
united to them by love.</p>

<p>Later on, Baroja says: “For me, one of the saddest things about Spain is
that we Spaniards cannot be frivolous or jovial.”</p>

<p>And for me it would be one of the saddest things for Spain if we
Spaniards could become frivolous and jovial. In that case we should
cease to be Spaniards, yet without even becoming Europeans. In that case
we should have to renounce our true consolation and our true glory,
which consists precisely in this inability to be either frivolous or
jovial. In that case we might be able to repeat in chorus all the
unsubstantialities of the popular scientific handbooks, but we should be
incapacitated for entering into the kingdom of wisdom. In that case we
might perhaps have better and finer wines, purer oil, better oysters;
but we should have to renounce the possibility of a new <i>Don Quixote</i>,
or a new Velazquez, and, above all, the possibility of a new St. John of
the Cross, a new Fray Diego de Estella, a new St. Teresa de
Jesús&#8212;whether orthodox or heterodox, it matters not which.</p>

<p>And Baroja concludes: “A sad country in which everywhere all people live
their lives thinking of nothing less than of life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">{63}</a></span>”</p>

<p>And this arbitrariness provokes my arbitrariness and I exclaim: Unhappy
those modern European countries in which people live their lives
thinking of nothing more than of life. Unhappy those countries in which
men do not continually think of death and in which the guiding principle
of life is not the thought that we shall all one day have to lose it.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Here I must halt a moment&#8212;if it is possible to speak of halts in a
course such as my thought is taking here&#8212;and explain, if it is possible
to explain it, what this arbitrariness really is.</p>

<p>Foreigners, the French in particular, take from us precisely that which
is least ours, that which least clashes with their spirit, and,
naturally enough, that which best accommodates itself to the idea that
they have formed of us, an idea that is always and necessarily
superficial. And we, poor fools, yield to this delusive adulation and
hope for this external applause, the applause of those who really don’t
hear us, and even when they do hear us don’t understand us.</p>

<p>I don’t really know what they want in taking from us just what they do
take, just that which confirms the popular notion they have of us. If I
were in their place, what I should take from Spain and make known to my
fellow-countrymen would be what was most wounding to their convictions,
what amazed them most, what was most repellent to their spirit, what was
most different from them.</p>

<p>But after all what they do is natural, for people want to be told just
that which they already think, that which confirms them in their
preconceived ideas, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_64">{64}</a></span> prejudices and their superstitions: men want
to be deceived. And so it is here.</p>

<p>In face of this attitude of theirs, what must be our attitude? In face
of this process that tends to decharacterize us, to rob us of that which
makes us what we are, what course of action is the best for us to adopt?
Admonished by those voices that say: “If you want to be like us and save
yourselves, take this,” what must we do?</p>

<p>But this question of attempting to Spaniardize Europe, the only means
whereby we may Europeanize ourselves, so far as it is fitting that we
should be Europeanized, or rather, whereby we may digest those elements
in the European spirit which we can convert into our spirit&#8212;this
question must be left for separate treatment.</p>

<p>All this will appear arbitrary&#8212;it is arbitrary. How can I help it?</p>

<p>“Enough,” some logical modern European reader will say; “now I’ve caught
you. You yourself admit that your assertions have no foundation, that
they are arbitrary, that they cannot be proved, and such assertions
ought not to be taken seriously.” And I will say to this poor logical
modern and European reader, who may be assumed to be in love with
science and life, that the fact that an assertion is arbitrary and
cannot be proved by logical reasons, does not mean either that it is
without foundation or, still less, that it is false. And above all it
does not mean that such an assertion may not excite and animate the
spirit, may not strengthen its inner life, that inner life which is a
very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">{65}</a></span> different thing from the life that the logical and scientificist
reader is in love with.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I broke off this essay at this point two days ago, with the intention of
continuing it, of resuming the broken thread, as occasion offered, and
now to-day, the 13th of May, I have just read a phrase that alters the
course of my discourse. Something of the kind happens to rivers when a
rock deflects their course and causes them to disembogue many leagues
away from where they would otherwise have disembogued, perhaps into
another sea altogether.</p>

<p>It is curious what happens to our ideas. We have often in our mind a
crowd of ideas that vegetate in the darkness, withered, incomplete,
unacquainted with one another and avoiding one another. For in the
darkness, ideas, like men, are afraid of one another. And they remain
obscured, disassociated, avoiding contact. But suddenly a new and
luminous idea enters the mind, emitting light and illuminating the dark
corner, and as soon as the other ideas see it and see their own faces,
they recognize one another, they arise and gather round the new arrival,
they embrace and form a fraternity and recover their full life.</p>

<p>So it has happened with me to-day when a number of half-alive and
shadowy ideas that have been lying isolated in a corner of my mind have
been joined by this new idea that I have just read in a Madrid
newspaper, <i>La Correspondencia de España</i>, of yesterday’s date, the 12th
of May.</p>

<p>In an article that it publishes, entitled “Current<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">{66}</a></span> Events&#8212;Cánovas,”
the author says: “Sagasta understood Spaniards, but not Spain. Cánovas
never knew of what stuff his fellow-countrymen were made.”</p>

<p>The moment that I read this, I realized, as if by a sudden illumination,
the difference that there is between the soul of Spain and the aggregate
of the souls of all us Spaniards who are living to-day, the actual
synthesis of these same souls. And I remembered that at the time of the
last Carlist civil war, when I was a boy, I heard someone in my native
town say: “Even though all we men of Bilbao were to become Carlists,
Bilbao would remain liberal.” A paradox&#8212;that is to say, a profound
arbitrary truth, a truth of passion, a truth of the heart, and one that
I shall never forget.</p>

<p>“Sagasta understood Spaniards, but not Spain.” And all our commonplace
rulers, those who let themselves drift with the stream and enjoy long
years of office, all our commonplace writers, those who write books that
are just long tirades, books that sell, all our commonplace artists and
all our commonplace thinkers, understand their fellow-countrymen, but
not their country.</p>

<p>Not only our own souls, the souls of us who are living to-day, are alive
and operative in the soul of Spain, but in addition to these, the souls
of all our forefathers. Our own souls, those of the living, are those
that are least alive in it, for our soul does not enter into the soul of
our country until it is no longer a detached entity, until after our
temporal death.</p>

<p>What is the use of our wanting to make our thought modern and European
when our language is neither European nor modern? While we are
endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_67">{67}</a></span> to make it say one thing, it is endeavouring to make us
say something different, and thus we don’t say the thought that we
pretend we are saying, but we say the thought that we don’t wish to say.</p>

<p>We endeavour&#8212;that is to say, many of us endeavour&#8212;to deform our spirit
conformably with an external standard, and we succeed neither in making
ourselves like those whom we pretend to copy nor in being ourselves.
Whence results a horrible spiritual half-breed, a kind of barren hybrid.</p>

<p>And the most curious thing about it all is this&#8212;something that will be
understood one day, if the day ever comes when anyone will occupy
himself in investigating the spiritual condition of Spain at the
transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries&#8212;the most
curious and surprising thing is that those who are held to be most
Spanish, most true-blooded and of the old stock, most authentically
Spanish, are those who are the most Europeanizing, the most exotic,
those whose soul contains the most alien strains; and on the other hand
those whom many simple-minded folk regard as exotic spirits, anglicized,
gallicized, Germanized, Norwegianized, are the ones whose roots
intermingle most closely with the roots of those who created the Spanish
soul. I have observed how frequently a skin-deep classicism, a
classicism of external grammatical and rhetorical forms, goes hand in
hand with a complete alienation from the national soul, and vice versa.
I have known a portentous fool, once an esteemed author, who used to
read our mystics in order to learn from them how to write good Castilian
and upon whom the ardent soul of these most genuinely<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_68">{68}</a></span> Spanish spirits
made no impression whatever; and on the other hand I know a man who,
although he has never read them nor concerned himself in any way to
preserve their literary tradition or their religious orthodoxy, in
breathing the national spiritual atmosphere has breathed the air of that
mysticism that is inherent in this atmosphere.</p>

<p>What is the origin of this confusion? I cannot tell, but I presume that
it must originate in the same cause that makes Spaniards insist on
calling him a wise man who has least wisdom in him and demanding logic
from a man who is passionate and arbitrary.</p>

<p>“People want and demand <i>things</i>,” so a friend of mine says to me when I
talk to him about these matters, “that is to say, concrete ideas,
utilizable facts, scientific theories, information, rational
explanations, and it is no use going to them with feelings and dreams.”
Usually my first thought on hearing this is, “Unfortunate people!” but
immediately afterwards I pull myself up and say: “They are partly right;
it is right that they should demand that; but why must so many of them
reject the other? and above all why should they not demand from each one
just that which he has and which he can give?”</p>

<p>And, to apply this to our own people, why must we persist in distorting
our inner nature and rejecting what it gives us in order to try to force
it to give us something else?</p>

<p>Our defects, or what others call our defects, are usually the root of
our excellencies; the qualities that are censured as our vices are the
foundation of our virtues. It is not a universal æsthetic, applicable
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_69">{69}</a></span> all peoples alike, a pure æsthetic&#8212;for I doubt whether such an
æsthetic exists or even can exist&#8212;that has condemned our conceptism and
gongorism, for example, and that has decreed that our genuine and
natural instinct for emphasis is in bad taste. It is not a universal
æsthetic, valid for all peoples alike, but the æsthetic of other
peoples, or rather of one other people, the French, that has imposed
this canon upon so many of us. The literary and artistic vices of this
terribly logical, desperately geometrical, Cartesian people are
certainly not those of conceptism or gongorism, and this people has
succeeded in great measure in teaching us its virtues and in teaching us
its vices. There is nothing more intolerable than gallicized Spanish
literature; nothing more false, more futile, more displeasing, than
Spanish writers who have formed themselves by imitating French
literature.</p>

<p>Emphasis? But what if emphasis is natural to us? What if emphatic
expression is the spontaneous expression of our nature? What if emphasis
is the form of passion, just as what is called naturalness is the
expression of sensuality and of good sense? What I am sure of is that
when a man is really irritated or really enthusiastic, he does not
express himself in concise, clear, logical, transparent phrases, but he
breaks out into emphatic exclamations, into redundant dithyrambs. What I
know, and what everybody knows, is that in love-letters, if the love be
real love, tragic love, love that cannot be happy, everything is poured
forth in a flood of burning commonplaces.</p>

<p>I have often thought that gongorism and conceptism are, in a certain
mode, expressions of passion. I af<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_70">{70}</a></span>firm it of conceptism, arbitrarily,
of course. Almost all the great men of passion that I am acquainted with
in the history of human thought, including the great African of whom I
have already spoken, have been conceptists, have poured forth their
longings, their aspirations, in antitheses, in paradoxes, in phrases
that at first sight seem to be merely ingenious. Perhaps this is owing
to the fact that passion is the enemy of logic, in which it sees a
tyrant, for passion desires that what it desires should exist, and does
not desire what must exist, and conceptism in its essence is a violation
of logic for the sake of logic itself. He plays with concepts and does
violence to ideas who is impeded by concepts and ideas, for he is unable
to make them comply with the demands of his passion.</p>

<p>I need the immortality of my soul, the indefinite persistence of my
individual consciousness&#8212;I need it. Without it, without faith in it, I
cannot live, and doubt, the inability to believe that I shall attain it,
torments me. And since I need it, my passion leads me to affirm it, and
to affirm it arbitrarily, and when I attempt to make others believe, to
make myself believe, I do violence to logic and make use of arguments
which are called ingenious and paradoxical by those unfortunate people
who have no passion and who contemplate their ultimate dissolution with
resignation.</p>

<p>The man of passion, the arbitrary man, is the only real rebel, and
nothing makes a more grotesque impression upon me than when I come
across those&#8212;usually gallicized&#8212;individuals who proclaim themselves
emancipated from all tyrannies, lovers of liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_71">{71}</a></span> <i>esprits forts</i>,
anarchists sometimes, frequently atheists, but who nevertheless are the
faithful devotees of logic and of the code of good taste.</p>

<p>Yes, emphasis, turgidity, conceptism, paradoxism, these are the language
passion speaks, and, on the other hand, there is nothing less natural,
for us Spaniards at any rate, than that which the French call <i>naturel</i>
and which is usually the refined product of an exquisite and artificial
elaboration.</p>

<p>Some Frenchman has said that French literature is that which gives the
most eloquent expression to the great commonplaces of humanity; but I
would say that it is in this literature, which has done and still does
so much harm in Spain, that all middling ideas and middling feelings
find their most adequate form and expression, and that it is hostile to
extreme ideas and extreme feelings.</p>

<p>Observe that the French spirit has produced no great mystic, no really
great pure mystic. Observe that upon Pascal, although he was somewhat
arbitrary and passionate, geometry made a profound impression. And
consider the fact that Pascal is one of the French spirits that we are
best able to appropriate. It is to this most profound and tortured
spirit that we owe two great and profound instances, among others, of
tormentingly arbitrary utterance: that of the <i>pari</i> or wager, and that
of <i>il faut s’abêtir</i>, “we must become as fools”&#8212;in order to believe,
beginning with acting as if we did believe. But I don’t know of any
great mystic, any really pure mystic, who was a Frenchman. And here I
should like to say something about the gentle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_72">{72}</a></span> tranquil, sensual and
logical St. Francis of Sales, so full of common sense and of a spiritual
<i>via media</i>, but I must leave it for some other time.</p>

<p>And it is the æsthetic of this people, so opposed to our own, in spite
of all that nonsense about the Latin sisterhood&#8212;I don’t know whether
they are Latin, I don’t know whether we are, and as regards myself
personally, I believe that there is nothing Latin about me&#8212;it is the
æsthetic of this people that is deforming the fruit of our spirit as it
is expressed in many of our spiritual creators.</p>

<p>Latins. Latins? And why, if we are really Berbers, must we not feel and
assert that we are Berbers, and why must not the poetry in which we
endeavour to give expression to our sorrows and our consolations conform
to the Berber æsthetic?</p>

<p>The only way of entering into vital relations with another is the
aggressive way; only those succeed in mutually penetrating one another,
in forming a spiritual brotherhood, who strive to subjugate one another
spiritually, whether in the case of individuals or of peoples. It is
only when I strive to put my spirit into the spirit of my neighbour that
I receive my neighbour’s spirit in mine. The apostle is blessed in
receiving in himself the souls of those whom he converts; in this
consists the nobility of proselytizing.</p>

<p>No, none of this <i>laissez-faire</i> and <i>laissez-aller</i>&#8212;don’t let us shrug
our shoulders at the ideas, still less at the feelings, of others, but
rather try to wound them. It is thus and only thus that they will wound
ours and keep them awake within us. For my part I know that those to
whom I owe most are those who have acted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_73">{73}</a></span> as if they rejected, who have
wished to reject, what I offered to them. The deep moral life is a life
of aggression and mutual penetration. Everyone must endeavour to make
others in his own image and likeness, as God is said to have made us in
His image and likeness.</p>

<p>The condemnation of him who tries to mould himself upon another lies in
the fact that he will cease to be himself without succeeding in being
the other whom he takes as his model, and so he will be nobody.</p>

<p>Unquestionably there is something, there are many things, in modern
European culture and in the modern European spirit that it behoves us to
receive into ourselves in order that we may convert them into our flesh,
just as we receive the flesh of various kinds of animals into our body
and convert it into our flesh. With the brains of oxen I nourish my
brain, with the ribs of hogs I make my heart beat, with fish and birds I
feed my body so that my spirit can plunge into the deeps and swim in
them and ascend to the heights and fly there. And must we not eat the
modern European spirit? Yes, but we first kill these oxen, hogs, fishes
and birds, upon which we nourish ourselves, imposing our will upon them,
and we must deal with this spirit in the same way before eating it.</p>

<p>I am profoundly convinced, arbitrarily of course&#8212;the more profoundly,
the more arbitrarily, as is always the case when truths of faith are
concerned&#8212;I am profoundly convinced that the real and deep
Europeanization of Spain, that is to say, our digestion of that part of
the European spirit which it is possible to convert into our spirit,
will not begin until we strive<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_74">{74}</a></span> to impose ourselves upon the European
spiritual order, to make the Europeans swallow our spirit, that which is
genuinely ours, in exchange for theirs, until we strive to Spaniardize
Europe.</p>

<p>And to-day&#8212;I say it with shame and sorrow&#8212;when a Spaniard seeks to
enter into the European world, that is to say, in the case of men of
letters, when he wishes to be translated, all that he is concerned about
is to deform himself, to de-Spaniardize himself, to leave the translator
nothing to do but to translate the letter, the external language. And
thus it is that one hears remarks like that which a Frenchman made to me
the other day, when, speaking of the translation of a contemporary
Spanish novel, he stated that it was better in French than in Spanish.
To this I replied that it had been translated back into its original
language.</p>

<p>Each human faculty has its method, that is to say, its procedure, its
mode of action. That which we call logic is the method of reason, the
way of discovering conclusions satisfactory to reason. In this way
science is made. But when it is a question neither of addressing nor
satisfying reason, there is no need of logic. And for my part, I rarely,
very rarely, address myself to the reason of those who hear or read me,
and when I do so, it is not I myself who speak or write, but rather an
artificial self&#8212;and because artificial, therefore detachable&#8212;which
those who hear or read me impose upon me.</p>

<p>It has been said that the heart has its logic, but it is dangerous to
call the method of the heart logic; it would be better to call it
<i>cardiac</i>.</p>

<p>And there is also the method of passion, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_75">{75}</a></span> arbitrariness and
which must not be confounded with caprice, as often happens. It is one
thing to be capricious and another very different thing to be arbitrary.</p>

<p>Arbitrariness, the brusque affirmation of a thing because I wish it to
be so, because I need it to be so, the creation of our vital
truth&#8212;truth being that which makes us live&#8212;is the method of passion.
Passion affirms and the proof of its affirmation is founded upon the
energy with which it is affirmed. It needs no other proofs. When some
poor intellectual, some modern European, opposes ratiocinations and
arguments to any of my affirmations, I say to myself: reasons, reasons,
and nothing more than reasons!</p>

<p>Although he deserved to have been a Spaniard for writing them, it was
not a Spaniard but an Englishman who wrote these lines:</p>

<p>
For nothing worthy proving can be proven<br>
Nor yet disproven; wherefore thou be wise,<br>
Cleave ever to the sunnier side of doubt,<br>
And cling to Faith beyond the forms of Faith.<br>
</p>

<p>It was Lord Tennyson who wrote these pregnant lines, and in the same
poem, “The Ancient Sage,” he tells us that “knowledge is the swallow on
the lake that stirs and sees the surface-shadow there, but never yet
hath dipt into the abysm.”</p>

<p>Let, then, my last words here, while I am preparing to consider how it
is possible to Spaniardize Europe, be that nothing worthy proving can be
proven nor yet disproven.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_76">{76}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_SPANISH_CHRIST"></a>THE SPANISH CHRIST</h2>

<p>He was a foreigner, a South American, and he came from Paris. “But these
Christs!&#8212;Good God!” he said to me, as we stood before one of the
bloodiest of those that are to be found in our cathedrals, “this thing
repels, revolts&#8212;&#8212; ”</p>

<p>“It revolts him who knows nothing of the cult of suffering,” I said. And
he replied: “But suffering is not blood. There is bloodless suffering,
serene suffering.” ...</p>

<p>And we began to talk about it.</p>

<p>I confessed to him that I have the soul of my people, and that I like
these livid Christs, emaciated, purple, bloody, these Christs that
someone has called ferocious. Lacking in art? Barbarous? I don’t know.
And I like these harsh Marias Dolorosas, rigid with grief.</p>

<p>The Spanish Christ&#8212;so Guerra Junqueiro has often said to me&#8212;was born
in Tangiers. Perhaps. Perhaps He is an African Christ. Would He be more
Christ if He were an Attic or a Parisian or an English Christ? For the
other Christ, the Galilean, the historical, we must bid farewell to. And
as for history as applied to Christianity.... This history is the
history of the last twenty centuries, and here, in Spain, history is
Spanish. He was born then, perhaps, in Tangiers. Not very far from
Tangiers was born St. Augustine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p>Bloodless, serene, purified suffering.... Yes, yes, “stylistic”&#8212;or
shall we say, artistic?&#8212;suffering. The cry of suffering breathed into a
flute and become a dirge. Very good. All that the Laocoön inspired in
Lessing was just that.</p>

<p>Very good. But it is the same with this kind of suffering as with irony.
Usually ironists are people who are never angry. He who is angry is
insulting. The ironist forgives everything and says that it is because
he understands everything. And what if it is because he understands
nothing? I don’t know.</p>

<p>This harsh, raw manner of ours&#8212;I said to my friend, the South
American&#8212;not everyone can bear it. It has been said that hate is rife
in Spain. Perhaps. Perhaps we begin by hating ourselves. You will find
many here, a great many, who dislike themselves. We follow the precept
of “love thy neighbour as thyself,” and since, in spite of inevitable
egoism, we do not love ourselves, so neither do we love our neighbours.
The ascetic and the egoist are made in the same way. Not that the
ascetic is not an egoist; egoistic he may indeed be, and with a
vengeance. But even when an egoist, he does not know how to love
himself.</p>

<p>When you see a bull-fight, I continued, you will understand these
Christs. The poor bull is also a kind of irrational Christ, a
propitiatory victim, whose blood cleanses us from not a few of the sins
of barbarism. And leads us, nevertheless, to others. But is it not true
that forgiveness leads us&#8212;unhappy humans!&#8212;to sin again?</p>

<p>My friend saw a bull-fight in Madrid and wrote to me as follows;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“You are right. The Spanish people likes violent spectacles, which
beget the emotion of tragedy, or rather of ferocity. I had no
difficulty in understanding this at the bull-fight last Sunday. I
understood it also when I conversed with various people, and in
particular with literary people, who tear one another to pieces
with unparalleled ferocity. Poor Christ, pierced and bathed with
blood! There is no hope that His wounds will ever heal in these
Spanish cathedrals or that the grimace of His frenzied pain will
ever relax&#8212;for here there is no knowledge of the return of Jesus
to heaven, after His martyrdom.”</p></div>

<p>Perhaps&#8212;who knows?&#8212;our heaven is martyrdom itself.</p>

<p>Not a few foreigners who have learnt to know us have been struck with
this ferocity with which, here in Spain, men of letters destroy one
another. Yes, here all men, but particularly artists and writers,
destroy one another with the ferocity of bull-fighters&#8212;or it may be
with the Christian ferocity of our Tangerine Christianity.</p>

<p>And I, who do not like bull-fights and never go to see them, I, who do
not like flaying my fellow writers (for the office of executioner
dirties the hands), I like these Tangerine Christs, purple, livid,
blood-stained and blood-drained. Yes, I like these bleeding and
exsanguious Christs.</p>

<p>And the smell of tragedy! Above all, the smell of tragedy!</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>You should read the great Sarmiento’s comparison between bull-fights and
tragedy, in his account of his journey in Spain about the middle of the
last century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span> In the bull-fight there is none of the insupportable
unities of the pseudo-classical tragedy, and there is, moreover, real
dying. Real dying, and, above all, real killing. The bull is killed just
as an infidel dog was killed by a good Spanish Christian in the good old
days&#8212;really killed.</p>

<p>For many people, perhaps for my friend the American, all this creates an
atmosphere difficult to breathe, an acrid atmosphere. But if you take
away the taste, other atmospheres too become insipid. It is like the
austere beauty of our bleak upland deserts. He who tempers his soul, or
distempers it&#8212;I know not which&#8212;in the contemplation of these
blood-stained and blood-drained Christs, never accustoms himself
afterwards to others.</p>

<p>And this hate, this same hate that circulates everywhere here, like a
subterranean stream of lava, this same hate ...</p>

<p>It has its source in what is deepest in ourselves; we hate ourselves and
not one another only, but each one his own self.</p>

<p>“But you people have no real love of life, although you are tenacious of
it,” another foreigner said to me once, a Frenchman, as one who makes a
discovery. And I replied: “Perhaps!” He exclaimed again: “But this is a
veritable cult of death!” And I answered: “Of death, no&#8212;of
immortality!” The fear that if we die, we die utterly and altogether,
makes us cling to life, and the hope of living another life makes us
hate this one.</p>

<p><i>La joie de vivre.</i> It has been translated <i>la alegría de vivir</i>. But it
is only a translation. This <i>alegría de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span> vivir</i>&#8212;let them say what they
like&#8212;is a gallicism. It is not an authentic Spanish phrase. I do not
remember to have met with it in any of our classics. For man’s greatest
crime is that of having been born.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Indeed it is!</p>

<p>And this same literary ferocity with which our men of letters bite and
tear and flay and quarter one another is not without its sharp
voluptuousness for the spectator. And it is in this strife that our
masterminds are tempered. Many of their ripest have been produced in the
atmosphere of defamatory coteries. And they carry with them, naturally
enough, the acrid flavour of their origin. They smell of hate. And the
public, scenting hate, becomes excited and applauds. Applauds as it does
at the bull-fight when it smells blood. Blood of the body or blood of
the soul, what is there else?</p>

<p>Is this cultured? is this civilized? is this European? I don’t know. But
it is Spanish.</p>

<p>Ought we to be ashamed of it? Why? Better to probe into it, scrutinize
it, stir up the depths of it, make ourselves fully conscious of this
hatred of our own selves. The evil lies in our being unconscious of it,
for once it is revealed to us for what it is, a hatred and abhorrence of
our own selves, it is already in the way of becoming ennobling and
strengthening and redeeming. Do you not remember that terrible paradox
of the Gospels about having to hate father and mother and wife and
children in order to take up the cross, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span> blood-stained cross, and
follow the Redeemer? Hatred of ourselves, when it is unconscious,
obscure, purely instinctive, almost animal, engenders egoism; but when
it becomes conscious, clear, rational, it is able to engender heroism.
And there is a rational hatred, yes, there is.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a triumphant, heavenly, glorious Christ, He of the
Transfiguration, He of the Ascension, He who sits at the right hand of
the Father; but He is for when we shall have triumphed, for when we
shall have been transfigured, for when we shall have ascended. But for
here and now, in this bull-ring of the world, in this life which is
nothing but tragic bull-fighting, the other Christ, the livid, the
purple, the bleeding and exsanguious.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_SEPULCHRE_OF_DON_QUIXOTE"></a>THE SEPULCHRE OF DON QUIXOTE</h2>

<p>You ask me, my friend, if I know of any way of loosing a delirium, a
vertigo, any kind of madness, upon these poor ordered and tranquil
multitudes who are born, eat, sleep, reproduce themselves and die. Is
there no means, you ask me, of reproducing the epidemic of the
Flagellants or of the Tarantists? And you talk of the millennium.</p>

<p>Like you, I often feel a nostalgia for the Middle Ages; like you, I
should like to live in the throes of the millennium. If we could make
people believe that on a given day, say the 2nd of May, 1908,&#8212;the
centenary of our shout of independence&#8212;Spain would come to an end for
ever, that on that day we should be scattered like sheep, then I believe
that the 3rd of May, 1908, would be the greatest day of our history, the
dawn of a new life.</p>

<p>But now it’s all hopeless, utterly hopeless. Nothing whatever matters to
anybody. And if any isolated individual attempts to agitate any problem
or question, he is supposed to be prompted either by self-interest or by
a thirst for notoriety and a passion for singularizing himself.</p>

<p>Not even madness is understood here to-day. Even of the madman they say
that there is method and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_83">{83}</a></span> reason in his madness. The wretched multitude
takes for granted the reason of unreason. If our Lord Don Quixote were
to rise again and return to this Spain of his, they would go about
looking for some ulterior purpose in his noble extravagances. If any one
denounces an abuse, attacks injustice, fustigates orthodox platitudes,
the slavish crowd asks: What is his object in that? What is he aiming
at? Sometimes they believe and say that he does it in the hope of being
paid to keep quiet; sometimes that he is actuated by base and despicable
passions of vengeance and envy; sometimes that his motive is vainglory,
that he only wants to make a stir in order to get himself talked about;
sometimes that he does it for the sake of killing time, for amusement,
for sport. Pity that there are so few who go in for this kind of sport!</p>

<p>Mark this well!&#8212;When confronted by any act of generosity, of heroism,
of madness, all these stupid bachelors, curates and barbers of to-day
think only of asking: Why does he do it? And as soon as they think they
have discovered the reason of the action, whether their supposition is
correct or not, they exclaim: Bah! he has done it for the sake of this
or for the sake of that. As soon as they know the <i>raison d’être</i> of a
thing, that thing has lost all its value for them. Such are the uses of
logic, filthy logic.</p>

<p>To understand is to forgive, it has been said. And these mean souls need
to understand in order to forgive their being humiliated, to forgive the
indirect reproach of deeds and words that show up their own meanness.</p>

<p>When it has occurred to them to ask themselves, stupidly enough, why God
made the world, they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_84">{84}</a></span> answered: For His own glory! And the fools
are as pompously satisfied with the answer as if they knew what is meant
by the glory of God.</p>

<p>Things are made first, their wherefore comes afterwards. Give me any new
idea about anything and it will tell me its wherefore afterwards.</p>

<p>Whenever I put forward some project, something which it appears to me
ought to be done, there is always somebody who is sure to ask me: And
afterwards? To such a question the only possible reply is another
question. To the “And afterwards?” one can only ripost by an “And
before?”</p>

<p>There is no future, there is never any future. This thing that is called
the future is one of the greatest of deceptions. The real future is
to-day. What is going to happen to us to-morrow? There is no to-morrow.
What is happening to us to-day? That is the only question.</p>

<p>And so far as to-day is concerned, all these petty souls are quite
content because to-day they exist. Existing suffices them. Existence,
sheer, naked existence, fills their whole soul. They don’t feel that
there is something more than existing.</p>

<p>But do they exist? Do they really exist? I believe not. For if they
existed, if they really existed, they would suffer because they existed,
existing would not content them. If they really and truly existed in
time and in space they would suffer because they did not exist in
eternity and in infinity. And this suffering, this passion, which is
nothing other than the passion of God in us, of God who in us suffers at
feeling Himself imprisoned in our finitude and our temporality, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_85">{85}</a></span>
divine suffering would cause them to break all those paltry logical
chains with which they seek to bind their paltry memories to their
paltry hopes, the illusion of their past to the illusion of their
future.</p>

<p>“Why does he do it?” Did Sancho, perchance, never inquire why Don
Quixote did the things that he did?</p>

<p>And to return to your question, to your preoccupation: With what
collective madness could we inoculate these tranquil multitudes? With
what delirium?</p>

<p>You yourself have hinted at a solution in one of those letters in which
you bombard me with questions. “Do you not believe,” you asked me, “that
it might be possible to start some new crusade?”</p>

<p>Yes, I believe that it is possible to start the holy crusade for the
redemption of the sepulchre of Don Quixote from the dominion of the
bachelors, curates, barbers, dukes and canons who have taken possession
of it. I believe that it is possible to start the holy crusade for the
redemption of the sepulchre of the Knight of Folly from the dominion of
the mandarins of Reason.</p>

<p>They will defend their usurpation, naturally, and will endeavour to
prove with many and elaborate reasons that the guard and custody of the
sepulchre belongs to them. They guard it in order that the Knight shall
not rise again.</p>

<p>These reasons must be answered with insults, with stone-throwings, with
shouts of passion, with lance-thrusts. These people are not to be
reasoned with. If you try to reason against their reasons, you are lost.</p>

<p>If they ask you, as they usually do, by what right you claim the
sepulchre, answer nothing. They will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_86">{86}</a></span>find out afterwards. Afterwards
... perhaps when both they and you no longer exist, at any rate not in
this world of appearances.</p>

<p>And this holy crusade has one great advantage over those other holy
crusades which spread the dawn of a new life upon this old world. Those
other ardent crusaders knew where the sepulchre of Christ was, where it
was said that it was; but our new crusaders will not know where the
sepulchre of Don Quixote is to be found. It must be sought for in the
act of fighting to redeem it.</p>

<p>Your quixotesque madness has led you more than once to speak to me of
quixotism as of a new religion. And I must tell you that this new
religion which you propose, if it should ever come to materialize, would
have two notable characteristics. First, that we are not sure whether
its founder, its prophet, Don Quixote&#8212;not Cervantes, of course&#8212;was a
real man, a man of flesh and bone; indeed, we rather suspect that he was
a pure fiction. And second, that this prophet was a ridiculous prophet;
the butt and laughing-stock of the world.</p>

<p>It is courage that we need most of all&#8212;courage to face ridicule.
Ridicule is the weapon wielded by all the miserable bachelors, barbers,
curates, canons and dukes who guard the hidden sepulchre of the Knight
of Folly. The Knight who made all the world laugh but never made a joke
himself. He had too great a soul to make jokes. He was laughed at for
his seriousness.</p>

<p>Begin then, my friend, to play Peter the Hermit and call the people to
join you, to join us, and let us all go to redeem this sepulchre which
lies we know not where. The crusade itself will reveal the holy place to
us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p>You will see that as soon as the sacred squadron begins to march, a new
star will appear in the sky, a bright and sounding star, which will sing
a new song in the long night that encompasses us, and the star will
begin to move when the squadron of the crusaders begins to march, and
when they have conquered in their crusade, or when they have all
succumbed&#8212;which is perhaps the only way of truly conquering&#8212;the star
will fall from the sky, and the place where it falls will be the place
of the sepulchre. The sepulchre will be where the squadron dies.</p>

<p>And where the sepulchre is, there is the cradle, there is the
birth-place. And from there the bright and sounding star will mount
again heavenwards....</p>

<p>Question me no more, dear friend. When you force me to speak of these
things, you force me to bring to light from the depths of my heart, sick
with the atmosphere of conventionality that harasses and oppresses me on
all sides, sick with the slime of the slough of falsehood in which we
are mired, sick with scrabbling cowardice which shows itself on every
hand, you force me to bring to light from the depths of my sick heart
visions without reason, concepts without logic, things of which I know
not the meaning and whose meaning I do not wish to try to fathom.</p>

<p>What do you mean by that? you ask me yet again. And I reply: Perhaps I
don’t even know myself.</p>

<p>No, my friend, no. The meaning of many of these utterances of my spirit
I do not know myself, or rather it is not I who know them. There is
someone within me who dictates them to me, who speaks them to me. I obey
him and I never penetrate within to behold his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_88">{88}</a></span> face or to ask his name.
Only I know that if I beheld his face and if he told me his name, I
should die that he might live.</p>

<p>I am ashamed of having sometimes created fictitious beings, the
personages of my novels, in order that I might put into their mouths
that which I dare not put into my own and make them say in jest what I
feel in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>You know me, and you know how far I am from intentionally going in
search of paradoxes, extravagances, and mannerisms&#8212;whatever some dull
fools may think. You and I, my good friend, my only absolute friend,
have often debated between ourselves as to what madness really is, and
we have commented upon that saying of Ibsen’s Brand, the spiritual son
of Kierkegaard, to the effect that the man who is mad is the man who is
alone. And we have agreed that madness ceases to be madness when it
becomes collective, when it is the madness of a whole people, of the
whole human race perhaps. In so far as a hallucination becomes
collective, becomes popular, becomes social, it ceases to be a
hallucination and becomes a reality, something that is external to each
one of those who share it. And you and I are agreed that the multitudes,
the people, our Spanish people, must be inoculated with some madness or
other, the madness of some one of its members who is mad&#8212;but really
mad, not mad only in jest. Mad, and not foolish.</p>

<p>You and I, my good friend, have been scandalized at that which they call
here fanaticism and which&#8212;to our shame be it said&#8212;is not fanaticism at
all. No, nothing is fanaticism that is regulated and restrained and
di<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">{89}</a></span>rected by bachelors, curates, barbers, canons and dukes; nothing is
fanaticism that carries a banner inscribed with logical formulas,
nothing that has a program, nothing that holds out for to-morrow merely
a proposition that an orator can develop methodically in a speech.</p>

<p>Once&#8212;do you remember?&#8212;we saw a group of eight or ten youths and one of
them said: “Let’s do something rash!” and the others followed him. And
you and I long for the people to get together and shout: “Let’s do
something rash!” and begin to march. And if any bachelor, any barber,
any curate, any canon or any duke should stop them and say: “My
children, that’s right! I see that you are bursting with heroism and
righteous indignation. I also will go with you. But before we all go,
and I along with you, to do this rash deed, don’t you think that we
ought to agree as to the rashness that we are going to commit?”&#8212;if any
of these mandarins should stop them and say that, then they ought to
knock him down on the spot and walk over him, trampling on him, and that
would be a beginning of the heroic rashness. Don’t you think, my friend,
that there are many lonely souls amongst us whose heart craves for some
rashness, something to set it aflame? Go then and see if you can’t
gather them together and form them into a squadron and start us on the
march&#8212;for I will go with them and march behind you&#8212;to redeem the
sepulchre of Don Quixote, which lies, thank God, we know not where. The
bright and sounding star will tell us.</p>

<p>But&#8212;you say in your hours of depression, when your spirit fails
you&#8212;may it not be that when we think we<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span> are marching forward into new
countries, we are really all the time revolving round the same spot? In
that case the star will rest quietly over our heads and the sepulchre
will be within us. And then the star will fall, but it will fall in
order that it may bury itself in our souls. And our souls will be turned
to light, and when they are all fused together in the bright and
sounding star, the star will mount upwards, brighter still, and it will
change into a sun, a sun of eternal melody, to lighten the sky of our
redeemed country.</p>

<p>Forward then! And take care that no bachelors, barbers, curates, canons
or dukes disguised as Sancho Panzas join the sacred squadron of
crusaders. No matter if they ask you for islands; what you have got to
do is to throw them out directly they ask to be informed of the
itinerary of the march, directly they begin to talk about a program,
directly they whisper to you and ask you, maliciously, to tell them the
whereabouts of the sepulchre. Follow the star! And do like the
Knight&#8212;redress the wrong that lies in front of you. Do now what is to
be done now; do here what is to be done here.</p>

<p>Begin the march! Where are we going? The star answers: To the sepulchre!
What are we going to do on the way, as we march? What? Fight! Fight, and
how?</p>

<p>How? If you come across a man who is telling lies, shout out Liar! in
his face, and forward! If you come across a man who is stealing, shout
out Thief! and forward! If you come across a man who is talking
fool-talk to a crowd listening with gaping mouths, shout out Idiots! and
forward! Always forward!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">{91}</a></span></p>

<p>“And is this the way,” a would-be crusader asks me, “that you propose to
abolish lying and thieving and foolishness from the world?” Why not? The
most pusillanimous of all pusillanimities, the most detestable and
pestilent sophistry of cowardice, is that of saying that it is no use
denouncing a thief because others will go on stealing, that nothing is
gained by calling a fool a fool to his face, for this will not lessen
the sum of foolishness in the world.</p>

<p>Yes, it has got to be repeated a thousand and one times&#8212;if you can
finish once, only once, utterly and for ever, with only one liar, then
you will have finished with lying for good and all.</p>

<p>March then! And throw out of the sacred squadron all those who begin to
pay too much attention to the step that has to be kept on the march, to
its time and rhythm. Above all, out with those who are always talking
about rhythm. They will turn your squadron into a quadrille and the
march into a dance. Out with them! Let them go and sing to the flesh
somewhere else.</p>

<p>Those who would seek to turn your marching squadron into a quadrille
call themselves and call one another poets. They are not. They are
anything else you like. They only go to the sepulchre out of curiosity,
to see what it is like, to get a new sensation, and to amuse themselves
on the way. Out with them!</p>

<p>They it is whose Bohemian tolerance contributes to the maintenance of
cowardice and falsehood and all the other ignominies that overwhelm us.
When they preach liberty, the only liberty they are thinking about is
that of making free with their neighbour’s wife.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_92">{92}</a></span> They are compact of
sensuality, and they have a sensual attitude even to the great ideas
that they are enamoured of. They are incapable of marrying themselves to
any great and pure idea and begetting a family upon it; they only
intoxicate themselves with ideas. They make mistresses of them, and
sometimes tire of them after a single night. Out with them!</p>

<p>If when on the march anyone wants to pluck a flower that smiles by the
roadside, let him pluck it, but in passing, without stopping, and let
him follow the squadron, whose leader must not take his eyes off the
bright and sounding star. And if he fastens the flower to his
breastplate, not to look at himself but for others to look at, out with
him! Let him go off, with his flower in his buttonhole, and dance
somewhere else.</p>

<p>Listen, my friend. If you wish to fulfil your mission and serve your
country, you must needs make yourself hateful to all those sensible
young men who see the world only through the eyes of the woman they
love. Or worse still: your words must be strident and bitter in their
ears.</p>

<p>The squadron must halt only at night, at the edge of the wood or in the
shadow of the mountain. The crusaders will pitch their tents, they will
wash their feet, they will sup on what their wives have prepared for
them, and afterwards they will beget sons on them, they will give them a
kiss, and then they will fall asleep and the following day they will
continue their march. And when any one of them dies, they will leave him
by the roadside, shrouded in his armour, to the mercy of the ravens. Let
the dead bury their dead.</p>

<p>If during the march anyone essays to play the fife<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">{93}</a></span> or the pipe or the
flute or the guitar or whatever it may be, break his instrument and
throw him out of the ranks, for he hinders the others from hearing the
song of the star. And, what is more, he himself does not hear it. And he
who does not hear the celestial song must not go in quest of the
sepulchre of the Knight.</p>

<p>They will talk to you, these poet-dancers. Pay no heed to them. He who
begins to play his Pan-pipes beneath the sky of heaven and does not hear
the music of the spheres, does not deserve to hear it. He does not know
the abyss-deep depths of the poetry of fanaticism, he does not know the
infinite poetry of empty temples, without lights, without ornament,
without images, without pomps, without incense, without anything of what
is called art.</p>

<p>Throw all these Pan-pipe dancers out of the squadron. Throw them out
before they leave you for a mess of pottage. They are the cynical
philosophers, the tolerant Bohemians, the good fellows who understand
everything and forgive everything. And he who understands everything
understands nothing and he who forgives everything forgives nothing.
They have no scruples about selling themselves. As they live in two
worlds at the same time, they are able to preserve their liberty in the
other world and sell themselves as slaves in this. They serve art and at
the same time they are the servants of López or Pérez or Rodriguez.</p>

<p>It has been said that hunger and love are the two mainsprings of human
life. Of this low human life, of the life of earth. The dancers dance
only because of hunger or because of love; hunger of the flesh, love
also of the flesh. Throw them out of the squadron and let<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">{94}</a></span> them dance
their fill in yonder meadow, while one plays the pipe, another claps his
hands to the music, and another sings in praise of his pottage or of his
mistress’s thighs. And there let them invent new dancesteps, new
pirouettes, new figures of a rigadoon.</p>

<p>And if anyone shall come to you and say that he knows how to construct
bridges and that perhaps a time will come when you will wish to avail
yourself of his science in order to cross over a river, out with him!
Out with the engineer! Rivers will be crossed by wading or swimming
them, even if half the crusaders drown themselves. Let the engineer go
off and build bridges somewhere else, where they are badly wanted. For
those who go in quest of the sepulchre, faith is bridge enough.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>My friend, if you want to fulfil your task duly, distrust art, distrust
science, or at any rate distrust that which is called art and science
and which is nothing but a wretched mockery of true art and true
science. Let your faith suffice you. Your faith will be your art, your
faith will be your science.</p>

<p>More than once, when I observed what pains you take in composing your
letters, I have doubted whether you would be able to accomplish your
work. They are full of erasures, emendations, corrections, Pan-pipings.
They don’t jet forth violently, driving out the plug. Occasionally your
letters degenerate into literature, into that filthy literature which is
the natural ally of all slaveries and of all ignominies. Slavedrivers
know well enough that when the slave is singing a hymn to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_95">{95}</a></span> liberty, he
is consoling himself for his slavery and not thinking about breaking his
chain.</p>

<p>But at other times I regain my faith and hope in you when I feel beneath
the hurrying, spontaneous, cacophonous words the voice trembling with
the fever that consumes you. There are times when your speech may be
said to belong to no determinate language. Let everyone translate it
into his own.</p>

<p>Aim at living in a continual vertigo of passion, be the passion that
dominates you what it may. Only men of passion achieve works that really
live and bear fruit. When you hear it said of someone that his works are
impeccable, in whichever sense that stupid word is employed, fly from
him&#8212;above all if he is an artist. Just as the man who is most a fool is
he who has never done or said a foolish thing, so the artist who is
least a poet, most anti-poetic&#8212;and among artists anti-poetic natures
are common&#8212;is the impeccable artist, the artist whom the Pan-pipe
dancers decorate with the pasteboard laurel crown of impeccability.</p>

<p>You are consumed, my friend, with a perpetual fever, with a thirst for
unfathomable, shoreless oceans, with a hunger for universes, with a
home-sickness for eternity. Reason is suffering to you. And you don’t
know what you want. And now, now you want to go to the sepulchre of the
Knight of Folly and there dissolve yourself in tears, consume yourself
in fever, die of your thirst for oceans, of your hunger for universes,
of your home-sickness for eternity.</p>

<p>Begin to march, alone. All the other lonely souls will march by your
side, even though you don’t see<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_96">{96}</a></span> them. Each one will think that he
marches alone, but together you will form a sacred battalion, the
battalion of the holy and unending crusade.</p>

<p>You don’t yet understand, my good friend, how all lonely souls, without
knowing one another, without beholding one another’s face, without
knowing one another’s names, journey together and lend one another
mutual support. The others, those who are not lonely, talk about one
another, offer one another their hands, congratulate one another, belaud
and denigrate one another, chatter among themselves&#8212;and each one goes
his own way. And they all fly from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>You don’t belong to the coterie but to the battalion of free crusaders.
Why do you hover round the walls of the coterie to hear what they are
cackling about inside? No, my friend, no! When you pass close to a
coterie, stop your ears, fling your word and go straight on, on to the
sepulchre. And let the word that you fling vibrate with all your thirst,
with all your hunger, with all your home-sickness, with all your love.</p>

<p>I remember that unhappy letter that you wrote me when you were on the
point of succumbing, of yielding, of joining the confraternity. I saw
then how much your solitude weighed upon you, that solitude which must
be your consolation and your strength.</p>

<p>You had arrived at the most terrible and desolating state of all; you
had approached the brink of the precipice of your perdition; you had
come to doubt your solitude, you had come to believe that you were
surrounded by companions. “May not this notion that I am alone,” you
said, “be mere cavilling, the fruit of pride, of petulance, perhaps of
madness? For when<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">{97}</a></span> I am tranquil, I see myself companioned, I feel my
hand warmly clasped, I hear voices of encouragement, words of sympathy,
I receive all kinds of proofs that I am not alone&#8212;far from it.” And I
saw you deceived and lost, I saw you flying from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>No, you are not deceived in the accesses of your fever, in the agonies
of your thirst, in the anguish of your hunger; you are alone, eternally
alone. Not only are the bites that you feel really bites, but those that
seem like kisses are bites too. Those who applaud you are hissing you,
they want to stop you marching to the sepulchre when they shout
“Forward!” Stop your ears. And, above all, beware of a terrible
temptation&#8212;however much you may try to shake it off, it will return to
you with the pertinacity of a fly&#8212;beware of the temptation to concern
yourself with how you appear to others. Think only of how you appear to
God, think only of the idea that God has of you.</p>

<p>You are alone, much more alone than you imagine, and yet, even so, you
have not arrived at absolute, utter, real solitude. Absolute, utter,
real solitude consists in not being even with yourself. And you will not
be really, utterly, absolutely alone until you have emptied yourself of
yourself, by the side of the sepulchre. Holy Solitude!</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>All this I said to my friend, and he answered me, in a long letter, full
of furious dismay, in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“All that you say is good, very good. But don’t you think that
instead of going in quest of the sepulchre of Don Quixote and
redeeming it from the bachelors, curates, bar<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_98">{98}</a></span>bers, canons and
dukes, we ought to go in quest of the sepulchre of God and rescue
it from the atheists and deists who occupy it, and there, giving
voice to our supreme despair and dissolving our heart in tears,
wait for God to rise again and save us from nothingness?”</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_HELMET_OF_MAMBRINO"></a>THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO</h2>

<p><i>“Pray, good gentlemen,” said the barber,<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “let us have your opinion
in this matter. I suppose you will grant this same helmet to be a
basin?” “He that dares grant any such thing,” said Don Quixote, “must
know that he lies plainly, if he is a knight; but, if a squire, he lies
abominably.”</i></p>

<p>That’s right, my lord Don Quixote, that’s right. It is courage, it is
the barefaced courage that is ready to affirm a thing aloud and before
all the world and to defend the affirmation of it to the death, it is
courage that creates all truths. Things are so much the truer the more
they are believed, and it is not intelligence but will that imposes them
upon the world.</p>

<p>“Now I swear before you all,” said Don Quixote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span> “by the order of
knighthood which I profess, that that is the same individual helmet
which I won from him, without the least addition or diminution.” To
which Sancho added, in timid support of his master: “That I will swear,
for since my lord won it, he never fought but once in it, and that was
the battle wherein he freed those ungracious galley-slaves, who by the
same token would have knocked out his brains with a shower of stones,
had not this same honest basin-helmet saved his skull.”</p>

<p>In “The Tragic Sense of Life” Unamuno says: “I wrote my <i>Vida de Don
Quixote y Sancho</i> in opposition to the Cervantists and erudite persons,
in order to make a living work of what was and still is for the majority
a dead letter. What does it matter to me what Cervantes intended or did
not intend to put into it and what he actually did put into it? What is
living in it is what I myself discover in it, whether Cervantes put it
there or not, what I myself put into and under and over it, and what we
all put into it. I wanted to track down our philosophy in it.”</p>

<p>Readers of Don Quixote will recall the encounter between the Knight of
La Mancha and the barber who had clapped his brass basin on his head to
keep his hat from being spoiled by the rain. Having routed his enemy,
the Knight seized the basin, which he asserted to be the golden helmet
of Mambrino, a famous Saracen (see <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, Canto I). When
afterwards the barber met Don Quixote at an inn and claimed his basin,
the dispute as to whether it was really a basin or a helmet was referred
to the rest of the company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_101">{101}</a></span> some of whom sided with the Knight and
others with the barber.</p>

<p>Basin-helmet? Basin-helmet, Sancho? We must not do you the injustice to
suppose that your calling it a basin-helmet was one of your sly
jokes&#8212;no, it marks the progress of your faith. You were unable to pass
from what your eyes assured you of, showing you the object in dispute in
the likeness of a basin, to what faith in your master assured you,
showing it to you in the likeness of a helmet, without catching at this
compromise of a basin-helmet. In this respect there are many Sanchos
like you and you have invented this notion that virtue consists in the
<i>via media</i>. No, friend Sancho, no, there is no basin-helmet that is
worth a straw. It is a helmet or it is a basin according to him who uses
it, or rather it is basin and helmet at the same time for it serves both
turns. Without the least addition or diminution it can and ought to be
both helmet and basin, all of it helmet and all of it basin; but what it
can never be nor ought to be, however much be added to it or taken away
from it, is basin-helmet.</p>

<p>The barber to whom the basin belonged found the other barber, Master
Nicolas, and Don Fernando and the curate and Cardenio and the judge more
emphatic, for to the amazement of all the others who were present they
insisted that it was a helmet. One of the four pursuivants, regarding
this as a laborious joke, became annoyed and treated those who said it
was a helmet as if they were drunk. Don Quixote called him a liar and
hurled himself upon him; both sides prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">{102}</a></span> battle and fell to
blows. Then it was that Don Quixote, thinking that he was certainly
involved in the disorder and confusion of King Agramant’s camp, lifted
up his voice and quieted the tumult.</p>

<p>What! it surprises you that the question as to whether the basin was a
basin or a helmet should have given rise to a general dispute? Other and
more involved disputes have broken out in the world with regard to other
basins and those not belonging to Mambrino. As to whether bread is bread
and wine wine and the like. Human sheep flock round Knights of the Faith
and maintain for various reasons or for no reason at all, that the basin
is a helmet, as the Knights assert, and they are surprisingly rewarded
for so maintaining it, and the strange thing is that most of those who
contend that it is a helmet really believe it to be a basin. The heroism
of Don Quixote communicated itself to his mockers, who became quixotized
in spite of themselves, and Don Fernando made one of the pursuivants
measure his length on the ground because he had dared to maintain that
the basin was not a helmet but a basin. Heroical Don Fernando!</p>

<p>Thus we see Don Quixote’s mockers mocked by him, quixotized in their own
despite, joining in the fray and fighting with all their might to defend
the Faith of the Knight, although without sharing it. I am
convinced&#8212;although Cervantes does not tell us so&#8212;I am convinced that
the partisans of the Knight, the quixotists or helmetists, after having
received and administered punishment, began themselves to doubt whether
the basin were a basin and to believe that it really was the helmet of
Mambrino, for their ribs bore evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_103">{103}</a></span> their belief. It must be
affirmed here yet again that it is martyrs who create faith rather than
faith that creates martyrs.</p>

<p>In few of his adventures does Don Quixote appear greater than in this
one, in which he imposes his faith upon those who mocked at it, so that
they are led to defend it with kicks and blows and to suffer for it.</p>

<p>And what was it that inspired them to do so? Simply his courage in
affirming before everybody that that basin, which he no less than they
saw with his own eyes to be a basin, was the helmet of Mambrino, for to
him it served the office of a helmet.</p>

<p>This is the courage of the purest water&#8212;that which resists not merely a
shock to the reason or decay of fortune or loss of honour, but also
being taken for a madman and an idiot.</p>

<p>This is the courage that we need in Spain and our soul remains paralysed
because of the lack of it. It is because of the lack of it that we are
neither powerful nor wealthy nor cultured; it is because of the lack of
it that we have no system of irrigation, no good harvests; it is because
of the lack of it that it doesn’t rain more on our drought-parched
fields, or that when it does rain it rains in torrents, sweeping away
the manure and sometimes sweeping away the houses too.</p>

<p>This seems to you like a paradox? Go into the country and propose to any
farmer some improvement in his methods of cultivation or the
introduction of a new kind of crop or of a new agricultural machine, and
he will say: “That doesn’t pay here.” “Have you tried it?” you ask, and
he simply repeats: “That doesn’t pay here.” He doesn’t know whether it
pays<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_104">{104}</a></span> or whether it doesn’t pay, for he hasn’t tried it and doesn’t mean
to try it. He would try it if he were sure of its success beforehand,
but the prospect of the possibility of a failure, with the consequent
mockery and derision of his neighbours, the possibility of their taking
him for a deluded fool or a lunatic, this prospect terrifies him and so
he doesn’t experiment. And then people are surprised at the triumph of
those who have the courage to face ridicule serenely, of those who rid
themselves of the herd-instinct.</p>

<p>In the province of Salamanca there was a remarkable man who rose from
the greatest poverty to be a millionaire. The peasants of the district,
with the sheep-like instincts of their kind, were only able to explain
his success by supposing that in his younger days he had embezzled
money, for these wretched peasants, crusted over with common sense and
entirely lacking in moral courage, believe only in theft and the
lottery. But one day I was told of a quixotic feat which this cattle
farmer had performed. It seems that he had brought sea-bream’s spawn
from the Cantabrian coast to put in one of his ponds! When I heard that,
I understood everything. He who has the courage to face the jeers which
are bound to be provoked by bringing the spawn of a salt-water fish to
put in a pond in Castile, he who does that deserves his fortune.</p>

<p>But it was absurd, you say? And who knows what is absurd and what is
not? And even if it were! Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of
achieving the impossible. There is only one way of hitting the nail on
the head and that is by hammering on the shoe a hundred times. And there
is only one way of achiev<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_105">{105}</a></span>ing a real triumph and that is by facing
ridicule with serenity. And it is because our agriculturists haven’t the
courage to face ridicule that our agriculture languishes in its present
backward condition.</p>

<p>Yes, all our ills spring from moral cowardice, from the individual’s
lack of staunch resolution in affirming his own truth, his own faith,
and defending it. The soul of this people, this flock of somnolent
sheep, is smothered and swathed in falsehood, and their stupidity
proceeds from their very excess of prudence.</p>

<p>It is claimed that there are certain principles that are beyond
discussion and when anyone attempts to criticize them the air rings with
shouts of protest. Not long ago I proposed that we should demand the
abolition of certain of the articles of our law of Public Instruction,
and a pack of poltroons began to bellow that such a course was
inopportune and impertinent, not to mention stronger and more offensive
epithets that were used. I am sick of hearing everything that is most
opportune called inopportune, everything that tends to disturb the
digestion of the full-bellied and infuriates fools. What are they afraid
of? That it will result in a brawl? that a new civil war will break out?
Better and better. That’s what we need.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s what we need&#8212;a new civil war. It is necessary to assert
that basins ought to be and are helmets and to get up a fight about it
like the fight they got up at the inn. A new civil war, let the weapons
be what they will. Can’t you hear those spiritless creatures whose
hearts are dried and shrivelled up reiterating that these kinds of
disputes lead to nothing practical? What do they understand by
practical? Can’t you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">{106}</a></span> hear them reiterating that there are discussions
which ought never to be broached?</p>

<p>There are plenty of cowardly spirits who are always drilling it into us
that we ought to leave religious questions on one side, that the first
thing to do is to become powerful and wealthy. And the poltroons don’t
see that it is just because we ignore what concerns our inward
well-being that we are not and never shall be wealthy and powerful. I
repeat it yet again, there will never be any agriculture or industry or
commerce in our country, nor roads where there ought to be roads, until
we have discovered our Christianity, which is Quixotic Christianity. We
shall never have a powerful and splendid and glorious and strong
external life until we have kindled in the hearts of our people the fire
of the eternal disquietudes. We cannot be rich so long as our life is
nothing but deceit, and deceit is our spirit’s daily bread.</p>

<p>Can’t you hear the solemn ass that opens his mouth and says: “It’s
forbidden to say that here”? Can’t you hear all those who are bound with
the fetters of falsehood talking about peace, a peace that is more
deadly than death itself? That terrible and ignominious rule which
figures in the list of regulations of almost all the social clubs in
Spain, “political and religious discussions prohibited”&#8212;does that say
nothing to you?</p>

<p>Peace! peace! peace! all the frogs of our national pond croak in chorus.</p>

<p>Peace! peace! peace! Yes, but peace established upon the triumph of
sincerity, peace established upon the overthrow of falsehood. Peace, but
not a peace of compromise, not a hollow political agreement, but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
comprehensive peace. Peace, yes, but only after the pursuivants have
recognized Don Quixote’s right to assert that the basin is a helmet;
and, furthermore, only after the pursuivants themselves have admitted
and affirmed that in the hands of Don Quixote the basin is a helmet. And
the wretched crowd that shout “Peace! peace!” dare to take upon their
lips the name of Christ! They forget that Christ said that He came not
to bring peace but war, and that because of Him they of the same
household should be divided against one another, father against son and
brother against brother. And this should be because of Him, because of
Christ, that His kingdom might be established, the social kingdom of
Jesus&#8212;which is the very reverse of that which the Jesuits call the
social kingdom of Jesus Christ&#8212;the kingdom of real sincerity and real
truth and real love and real peace. In order that the kingdom of Jesus
may be established, there must be war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="DON_QUIXOTES_NIECE"></a>DON QUIXOTE’S NIECE<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>

<p>The good Alonso Quixano went on with the dictation of his will and
bequeathed all his estate to Antonia Quixano, his niece, but imposing it
upon her, as a necessary condition of enjoying the bequest, that “if she
is desirous of marrying, she marry none but a man who, upon strict
inquiry, shall be found never to have read a book of knight-errantry in
his life; and in case it appears that he has been conversant with such
books, and that she persists in her resolution to marry him, she is then
to forfeit all that I have bequeathed her, which in such case my
executors shall dispose of to pious uses at their own discretion.”</p>

<p>How clearly Don Quixote recognized the violent mutual incompatibility
that exists between the office of husband and that of knight-errant! And
in dictating this clause, may not the good knight have been thinking of
his Aldonza and of how, had he but ventured to break the seal of his too
great love, he might<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">{109}</a></span> have been spared all the misfortunes of his
knight-errantry and remained by his own fireside a happy prisoner in the
arms of his love?</p>

<p>Your will has been faithfully executed, Don Quixote, and the young men
of this your country have renounced all knight-errantry so that they
might enjoy the estates of your nieces&#8212;and among these must be counted
almost all the women of Spain&#8212;and enjoy the nieces themselves too. In
their arms all heroism is smothered. They tremble lest it should strike
their lovers and husbands with its rushing wind as it struck their
uncle. It is your niece, Don Quixote, it is your niece who rules and
governs Spain to-day&#8212;it is your niece, not Sancho. It is the timorous,
home-keeping, narrow-souled Antonia Quixano, she who feared lest you
should turn poet, “a catching and incurable disease”; she who so
zealously assisted the curate and the barber in burning your books; she
who presumed to tell you to your face that all stories of
knight-errantry were nothing but a pack of lies and fables&#8212;a maidenly
audacity which provoked you to exclaim: “By the God that sustains me,
wert thou not my proper niece, my own sister’s daughter, I would take
such revenge for the blasphemy thou hast uttered as would resound
through the whole world”; it is she, “the young baggage who scarce knows
how to manage a dozen lace-work bobbins,” and who presumed to put in her
oar and censure the histories of knights-errant, it is she who manages
and dangles and juggles with the sons of your Spain as if they were
puppets. It is not Dulcinea del Toboso, no. Neither is it Aldonza
Lorenzo, she for whom you sighed for twelve years without seeing her
more than four times<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span> and without ever confessing your love. It is
Antonia Quixano, she who scarce knew how to manage a dozen lace-work
bobbins, who controls your countrymen to-day.</p>

<p>It is Antonia Quixano, who, because she has a small soul and no belief
in her husband’s greatness, keeps him at home and hinders him from going
forth to seek heroic adventures which would win him glory and an
everlasting name. If it were only Dulcinea!... Dulcinea, yes, for
however strange it may seem, Dulcinea can make a man renounce all glory,
can make him choose the glory of renouncing glory. Dulcinea, or let us
rather call her Aldonza, the ideal Aldonza might say to him: “Come, come
to my arms and let all your wild longings melt away in tears upon my
breast. Come to me. Yes, I see you set up on a lofty pinnacle for all
time, I see all your brother men gazing up at you, I see you acclaimed
by generations yet unborn&#8212;but come to me, renounce it all for my sake,
and that will make you great, my Alonso, that will make you greater
still. Take my mouth and cover it with warm kisses in silence, and
renounce a cold eternity of fame in the mouths of those whom you will
never know. Will you hear them speaking of you when you are dead? Bury
all your love in my breast, and if it is a great love, it is better that
you should bury it in me than that you should lavish it among men who
easily forget and soon pass away. They are not worthy of admiring you,
my Alonso, they are not worthy of it. You will live for me alone and so
you will live more truly for all the universe and for God. So living,
your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">{111}</a></span> might and your heroism will seem to be lost, but don’t mind that.
Do you not know the infinite streams of life which flow from a silent
and heroic love, flowing out in wave after wave beyond humanity to the
orbit of the remotest of the stars? Do you not know that the silent and
triumphant love of a happy pair of lovers is a fount of mysterious
energy that irradiates a whole people and all generations to come to the
end of time? Do you not know what it is to guard the sacred fire of
life, fanning it to ever brighter flame in simple and silent worship?
Love, the simple act of loving, without deeds, is itself a heroic deed.
Come and renounce all your deeds in my arms&#8212;the dim obscurity of your
repose in my arms will be a seed-time which will bear fruit in the deeds
and glory of others to whom your very name will be unknown. When even
the echo of your name is no longer borne upon the air, when there is no
longer any air to bear the echo of it, the embers of your love will warm
the ruins of perished worlds. Come and give yourself to me, Alonso, for
though you should never ride abroad redressing wrongs, your greatness
will not be lost, for in my heart nothing is lost. Come, rest your head
upon my heart and I will carry you thence to the rest that has no
ending.”</p>

<p>With such words Aldonza might speak, and in renouncing all glory in her
arms Alonso would be truly great; but such words you can never speak,
Antonia. You do not believe that love is of more worth than glory; what
you believe is that neither love nor glory is worth as much as sleepy
fireside peace and quiet, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_112">{112}</a></span> neither love nor glory is worth as much
as the certainty of the daily mess of pottage; you believe that those
who don’t sleep easily in their beds come to a bad end, and you don’t
know that love, like glory, never sleeps but watches.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_RELIGION_OF_QUIXOTISM"></a>THE RELIGION OF QUIXOTISM</h2>

<p>I become more and more convinced that our philosophy, the Spanish
philosophy, is liquescent and diffused in our literature, in our life,
in our action, above all in our mysticism, and not in philosophical
systems. It is concrete. (And is there not perhaps as much philosophy or
more in Goethe, for example, as in Hegel?) The poetry of Jorge Manrique,
the Romancero, <i>Don Quijote</i>, <i>La Vida es Sueño</i>, <i>La Subida al Monte
Carmelo</i>, imply an intuition of the world and a concept of
life&#8212;<i>Weltanschauung und Lebensansicht</i>. This philosophy of ours could
with difficulty formulate itself in the second half of the nineteenth
century, a period that was a-philosophical, positivist, technicist,
given up to pure history and the natural sciences, a period essentially
materialist and pessimistic.</p>

<p>We shall find the hero of Spanish thought, perhaps, not in any
philosopher who lived in flesh and bone, but in an entity of fiction and
of action, more real than all the philosophers&#8212;in Don Quixote. For
there is doubtless a philosophic Quixotism, but there is also a Quixotic
philosophy. Was not perhaps the philosophy of the Conquistadores, of the
Counter-Reformers, of Loyola, and, above all, the philosophy latent in
the abstract but passionate thought of our mystics, in its essence none
other than this? What was the mysticism of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">{114}</a></span> St. John of the Cross but a
knight-errantry of the heart in the divine warfare?</p>

<p>And the feeling that animated Don Quixote cannot strictly be called
idealism; he did not fight for ideas. It was spiritualism; he fought for
the spirit.</p>

<p>Speculative or meditative Quixotism is, like practical Quixotism,
foolishness, a daughter-foolishness to the foolishness of the cross. And
therefore it is contemned by reason. Philosophy at bottom abhors
Christianity, and well did the gentle Marcus Aurelius prove it.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Christ, the divine tragedy, is the tragedy of the Cross.
Pilate, the sceptic, the man of culture, sought by means of ridicule to
turn it into comedy and conceived the farce of the king with the reed
sceptre and crown of thorns, saying: “Behold the man!” But the people,
more human than he, the people that thirsts for tragedy, cried: “Crucify
him! crucify him!” And the other tragedy, the human, the intra-human
tragedy, is that of Don Quixote with his face lathered for the ducal
servants to laugh at, and for the dukes, as much slaves as their
servants, to laugh at too. “Behold the fool!”&#8212;so they would say. And
the comic, the irrational tragedy is suffering beneath ridicule and
contempt.</p>

<p>For an individual, as for a people, the highest heroism is being willing
to face ridicule&#8212;still more, being willing to make oneself ridiculous
and not flinching at the ridicule.</p>

<p>Antero de Quental, the tragic Portuguese who committed suicide, wrote as
follows, smarting under the ultimatum which England delivered to his
country in 1890: “An English statesman of the last century, also<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">{115}</a></span>
certainly a perspicacious observer and a philosopher, Horace Walpole,
said that life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those
who think. Very well then, if we have to end tragically, we Portuguese,
we who <i>feel</i>, we much prefer this terrible, but noble, destiny to that
which is reserved, and perhaps at no very remote future date, for
England, the country that <i>thinks</i> and <i>calculates</i>, whose destiny is to
end miserably and comically.” We may leave on one side the assertion
that England thinks and calculates, implying that she does not feel, the
injustice of which is explained by the circumstance that provoked it,
and also the assertion that the Portuguese feel, implying that they
scarcely ever think or calculate&#8212;for we sister peoples of the Atlantic
have always been distinguished by a certain sentimental pedantry; but
there remains the terrible underlying idea, namely, that some, those who
put thought above feeling&#8212;I should say reason above faith&#8212;die
comically, and those die tragically who put faith above reason. For it
is the ridiculers who die comically, and God laughs at their comic
ending, while the portion, the noble portion, of those who are ridiculed
is tragedy.</p>

<p>And what we must look out for in the record of Don Quixote is ridicule.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The philosophy in the soul of my people presents itself to me as the
expression of an inward tragedy analogous to the tragedy of the soul of
Don Quixote, as the expression of a conflict between the world as the
reason of science exhibits it to us and the world as we wish it to be,
as our religious faith tells us that it is.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_116">{116}</a></span> And in this philosophy is
to be found the secret of what is usually said about us, that we are
fundamentally irreducible to <i>Kultur</i>, that is to say, that we do not
resign ourselves to it. No, Don Quixote resigns himself neither to the
world nor to its truth, neither to science nor to logic, neither to art
nor aesthetics, neither to morality nor to ethics.</p>

<p>“In any case the result of all this,” so I have been told more than once
and by more than one person, “will simply be to urge people on to the
maddest kind of Catholicism.” And they have accused me of being a
reactionary and even a Jesuit. So be it! And what then?</p>

<p>Yes, I know, I know that it is folly to seek to turn the waters of the
river back to their source, and that it is the crowd that seeks the
medicine for its ills in the past; but I know too that everyone who
fights for any ideal whatsoever, even though it may seem to belong to
the past, is urging the world on to the future, and that the only
reactionaries are those who find themselves at ease in the present.
Every pretended restoration of the past is a creation of the future, and
if the past is dream, something not properly known, so much the better.
As always, the march is towards the future; he who marches, marches
thither, even though he march backwards way&#8212;and who knows if that is
not the better way?</p>

<p>I feel that I have a mediæval soul and I believe that the soul of my
country is mediæval&#8212;that it has been forced to traverse the
Renaissance, the Reformation and the Revolution, learning from them,
yes, but without allowing them to touch the soul, preserving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_117">{117}</a></span>
spiritual heritage of those ages that are called dark. And Quixotism is
nothing but the most desperate phase of the struggle of the Middle Ages
against their offspring, the Renaissance.</p>

<p>And if some accuse me of furthering the cause of Catholic reaction,
perhaps the others, the official Catholics, accuse me of.... But these,
in Spain trouble themselves little about anything and are only
interested in their own quarrels and dissensions. And besides, poor
folk, they are somewhat dull of understanding.</p>

<p>But the fact is that my work&#8212;I was going to say my mission&#8212;is to
shatter the faith of both these and those and of others besides, faith
in affirmation, faith in negation and faith in abstention, and this for
the sake of faith in faith itself; it is to war against all those who
resign themselves, whether to Catholicism or to rationalism or to
agnosticism; it is to make them all live lives of inquietude and
passionate desire.</p>

<p>Will this work be efficacious? But did Don Quixote believe in the
immediate and visible efficacy of his work? It is greatly to be doubted,
and at any rate he did not risk putting the visor he had made to the
test by giving it a second blow. And many passages in his history
indicate that he did not believe much in the immediate success of his
design to restore knight-errantry. And what did it matter so long as he
himself thus lived and immortalized himself? And he must have surmised,
and did in fact surmise, that his achievement would have another and a
higher efficacy&#8212;namely, that it would go on working in the minds of all
those who in the spirit of devotion read of his exploits.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<p>Don Quixote made himself ridiculous, but did he perchance know the most
tragic ridicule of all, the ridicule that is reflected in the eyes of a
man’s own soul, the ridicule with which a man sees his own self?
Transfer Don Quixote’s battlefield to his own soul; conceive him to be
fighting in his soul to save the Middle Ages from the Renaissance, not
to lose the treasure of his infancy; turn him into an inward Don
Quixote&#8212;with his Sancho, a Sancho equally inward and equally heroical
at his side&#8212;and then talk to me of the comic tragedy.</p>

<p>And what has Don Quixote left, do you ask? I answer that he has left
himself, and a man, a living and eternal man, is worth all theories and
all philosophies. Other peoples have left principally institutions,
books&#8212;we have left souls. St. Teresa is worth any institution, any
“Critique of Pure Reason.”</p>

<p>Don Quixote was converted? Yes, but only to die. But the other, the real
Don Quixote, he who remained on earth and lives among us, breathing his
spirit into us, this Don Quixote was never converted, this Don Quixote
goes on inciting us to make ourselves ridiculous, this Don Quixote must
never die. And the conversion of the other Don Quixote&#8212;he who was
converted only to die&#8212;was possible because he was mad, and it was his
madness, not his death or his conversion, that immortalized him and
earned for him the forgiveness of the crime of having been born. <i>Felix
culpa!</i> Neither was his madness cured but only transformed. His death
was his last knightly adventure&#8212;in dying he stormed heaven, which
suffereth violence.</p>

<p>This Don Quixote died and descended into hell, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">{119}</a></span> he entered it lance
on rest and freed all the condemned, as he freed the galley-slaves, and
he shut the gates of hell, and tore down from them the scroll that Dante
saw there, and replaced it by one on which was written “Long live hope!”
and escorted by those whom he had freed, and they laughing at him, he
went to heaven. And God laughed at him paternally and this divine
laughter filled his soul with eternal happiness.</p>

<p>And the other Don Quixote remained here amongst us, fighting with
desperation. Is not despair the mainspring of his fighting? How is it
that among the words that English has borrowed from our
tongue&#8212;<i>siesta</i>, <i>camarilla</i>, <i>guerilla</i> and the like&#8212;there occurs
this word <i>desperado</i>? This inward Don Quixote that I spoke of,
conscious of his own comicness, is he not a man of
despair&#8212;<i>desesperado</i>? A desperado, yes, like Pizarro and like Loyola.
But “despair is the master of impossibilities,” as Salazar y Torres
tells us, and it is despair and despair alone from whence springs heroic
hope, absurd hope, mad hope. <i>Spero quia absurdum</i>, it ought to be said,
rather than <i>credo</i>.</p>

<p>And Don Quixote, who lived solitary, sought more solitude still, sought
the solitudes of the Peña Pobre in order that there, alone, without
witnesses, he might plunge into yet wilder extravagances to the easing
of his soul. Yet he was not quite solitary, for Sancho accompanied him,
Sancho the good, Sancho the believing, Sancho the simple. If, as some
say, in Spain Don Quixote is dead and Sancho lives, then we are saved,
for Sancho, his master dead, will become a knight-errant himself. At any
rate he is waiting for some other mad knight to follow yet again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span></p>

<p>And there is also a tragedy of Sancho. The other Sancho, the Sancho who
journeyed with the mortal Don Quixote&#8212;it does not appear certain that
he died, although some say that he died hopelessly mad, calling for his
lance, and believing that all those things which on his death-bed his
converted master abominated as lies had been really true. But neither
does it appear certain that the bachelor Sanson Carrasco, or the curate,
or the barber, or the dukes and canons are dead, and it is with these
that the heroic Sancho has to fight.</p>

<p>Don Quixote journeyed alone, alone with Sancho, alone with his solitude.
And shall we not also journey alone, we his lovers creating for
ourselves a quixotesque Spain which exists only in our imagination?</p>

<p>And again we shall be asked: What has Don Quixote bequeathed to
<i>Kultur</i>? I answer: Quixotism, and that is no little thing. It is a
whole method, a whole epistemology, a whole aesthetic, a whole logic, a
whole ethic, above all a whole religion, that is to say, a whole economy
of things human and divine, a whole hope in the rationally absurd.</p>

<p>For what did Don Quixote fight? For Dulcinea, for glory, for life, for
survival. Not for Iseult, who is the eternal flesh; not for Beatrice,
who is theology; not for Margaret, who is the people; not for Helen, who
is culture. He fought for Dulcinea, and he won her, for he lives.</p>

<p>And what is greatest in him is his having been ridiculed and overcome,
for it is in being overcome that he overcame; he overcame the world by
making it laugh at him.</p>

<p>And to-day? To-day he feels his own comicness<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_121">{121}</a></span> and the vanity of his
efforts so far as temporal issues are concerned; he sees himself from
without&#8212;culture has taught him to objectify himself, that is to say, to
alienate himself from himself instead of to enter into himself, and in
seeing himself from without he laughs at himself, but with a bitter
laughter. Perhaps the most tragic character would be an inward Margutte,
who, like the Margutte of Pulci, should die bursting with laughter, but
with laughter at himself. <i>E riderá in eterno</i>, he will laugh for all
eternity, said the Angel Gabriel of Margutte. Do you not hear the
laughter of God?</p>

<p>The mortal Don Quixote, in dying, understood his own comicness and wept
for his sins; but the immortal Don Quixote understands and rises above
his comicness and triumphs over it without renouncing it.</p>

<p>But now Don Quixote hears his own laughter, he hears the divine
laughter, and since he is not a pessimist, since he believes in eternal
life, he has to fight, attacking the modern scientific inquisitorial
orthodoxy by adducing a new and impossible Middle Age, dualistic,
contradictory, passionate. Like a new Savonarola&#8212;an Italian Quixote of
the end of the fifteenth century&#8212;he fights against this Modern Age
which began with Machiavelli and which will end comically. He fights
against the rationalism inherited from the eighteenth century. Peace of
consciousness, reconciliation between reason and faith, are now, thanks
to the providence of God, impossible. The world must be as Don Quixote
wishes it to be, and inns must be castles, and he will fight against it
and will, to all appearances, be overcome, but he will triumph by making
himself ridic<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span>ulous. He will triumph by laughing at himself and making
himself laughed at.</p>

<p>“Reason speaks and feeling bites,” said Petrarch; but reason also bites
and bites in the heart of hearts. And more light does not make more
warmth. “Light, light, more light!” they tell us that the dying Goethe
cried. No, warmth, warmth, more warmth, for we die of cold and not of
darkness. It is not the night but the frost that kills.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The philosophy of Bergson, which is a spiritualist restoration, in its
essence mystical, mediæval, quixotesque, has been called <i>demi-mondaine</i>
philosophy. Leave out the <i>demi</i>; call it <i>mondaine</i>, mundane.
Mundane&#8212;yes, for the world and not for philosophers, just as chemistry
ought not to be for chemists alone. The world wishes to be
deceived&#8212;<i>mundus vult decipi</i>&#8212;either with the illusion antecedent to
reason, which is poetry, or with the illusion subsequent to reason,
which is religion. And Machiavelli has said that whosoever wishes to
deceive will always find someone who will let himself be deceived. And
blessed are those who are made fools of. A Frenchman, Jules de Gaultier,
has said that it was the privilege of his countrymen <i>n’être pas
dupe</i>&#8212;not to be taken in. A sorry privilege!</p>

<p>Science does not give Don Quixote what he demands of it. “Then let him
not demand it,” it will be said, “let him resign himself, let him accept
life and truth as they are.” But he does not accept them as they are,
and he asks for signs, urged thereto by Sancho who stands by his side.
And it is not that Don Quixote does not understand what those understand
who talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_123">{123}</a></span> thus to him, those who are able to resign themselves and to
accept rational life and rational truth. No, it is that the needs of his
heart are greater. Pedantry? Who knows?</p>

<p>And in this critical century Don Quixote, who has contaminated himself
with criticism also, has to attack his own self, the victim of
intellectualism and sentimentalism, and it is when he wishes to be most
spontaneous that he appears most affected. And the poor fellow wishes to
rationalize the irrational and irrationalize the rational. And he sinks
into the inner despair of the critical century whose two greatest
victims were Nietzsche and Tolstoi. And through despair he attains the
heroic fury of which Giordano Bruno spoke&#8212;that Don Quixote of the mind
who escaped from the cloister&#8212;and he becomes an awakener of sleeping
souls (<i>dormitantium animorum excubitor</i>), as the ex-Dominican said of
himself. “Heroic love,” Bruno wrote, “is the property of those superior
natures called insane [<i>insano</i>]&#8212;not because they do not know [<i>non
sanno</i>], but because they over-know [<i>soprasanno</i>].”</p>

<p>But Bruno believed in the triumph of his doctrines&#8212;at any rate they
have stated on the inscription at the foot of his statue in the Campo
dei Fiori, opposite the Vatican, that it is dedicated to him by the age
which he foretold (<i>il secole da lui divinato</i>). But our Don Quixote,
the Don Quixote who has risen from the dead, the inward Don Quixote, the
Don Quixote who is conscious of his own comicness, does not believe that
his doctrines will triumph in this world, because they are not of it.
And it is better that they should not triumph. And if the world wished
to make Don Quix<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_124">{124}</a></span>ote king, he would retire to the mountain, fleeing from
the king-making and king-killing crowds, as Christ retired alone to the
mountain when, after the miracle of the loaves and fishes, they sought
to proclaim Him king. He left the title of king to be written upon the
cross.</p>

<p>What, then, is the new mission of Don Quixote in the world of to-day? To
cry aloud, to cry aloud in the wilderness. But the wilderness hears,
though men do not hear, and one day it will be transformed into a
sounding forest, and this solitary voice that falls upon the wilderness
like seed, will yield a gigantic cedar, which with its hundred thousand
tongues will sing an eternal hosanna to the Lord of life and of death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="LARGE_AND_SMALL_TOWNS"></a>LARGE AND SMALL TOWNS</h2>

<p>I regret that I have not by me a certain essay dealing with this subject
by Guglielmo Ferrero. I read it in some review the name of which I have
forgotten, but I preserve a clear recollection of it, for it interested
me greatly. Ferrero treated the subject from the historical and
sociological point of view, and I, who am neither an historian nor a
sociologist, intend to treat it, as is my custom, from the point of view
of purely personal opinion and individual impression. (This is my
custom, and yet in spite of the fact I cannot prevent people from
insisting on calling me a savant and talking about my theories. I have
no theories. I have only impressions and sensations.)</p>

<p>But, since I am unable to put some quotation from Ferrero at the head of
this essay&#8212;this habit of basing our assertions upon authority is the
conventional way of giving them a deceptive air of objectivity&#8212;I will
head it by a sentence from George Meredith, that extremely subtle
English novelist. In “The Egoist” it is stated that Willoughby
“abandoned London as the burial-place of the individual man.”</p>

<p>I, to-day, am one with Willoughby in believing that great cities
de-individualize, or rather de-personalize, us. This may perhaps be due
to the fact that, though not an egoist like the hero of Meredith’s
novel, I still remain, according to Ramiro de Maeztu, an incorrigible
egotist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>Great cities are levelling; they lift up the low and depress the high;
they exalt mediocrity and abase superlativeness&#8212;the result of the
action of the mass, as powerful in social life as in chemistry.</p>

<p>Soon after I came to this ancient city of Salamanca which has now become
so dear to me, a city of some thirty thousand souls, I wrote to a friend
and told him that if after two years’ residence here he should be
informed that I spent my time playing cards, taking siestas and
strolling round the square for a couple of hours every day, he might
give me up for lost; but if at the end of that time I should still be
studying, meditating, writing, battling for culture in the public arena,
he might take it that I was better off here than in Madrid. And so it
has proved to be.</p>

<p>I remember that Guglielmo Ferrero’s conclusion, based upon a review of
ancient Greece, of the Italy of the Renaissance and of the Germany of a
century ago, is that for the life of the spirit, small cities of a
population like that of Salamanca are the best&#8212;better than very small
towns or large ones of over a hundred thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>This depends, of course, upon the quality of the spirit in question. I
am convinced that the monastic cloister, which so often atrophies the
soul and reduces the average intelligence to a lamentable slavery to
routine, has in certain exceptional cases exalted the spirit by its
arduous discipline.</p>

<p>Great cities are essentially democratic, and I must confess that I feel
an invincible platonic mistrust of democracies. In great cities culture
is diffused but vulgarized. People abandon the quiet reading of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span> books
to go to the theatre, that school of vulgarity; they feel the need of
being together; the gregarious instinct enslaves them; they must be
seeing one another.</p>

<p>I think it was Taine who observed that the majority of French geniuses
were either themselves country-born or the sons of country-born parents.
And I assure you that I should find it difficult to believe in the
genius of a Parisian born of Parisians.</p>

<p>Guerra Junqueiro once said to me: “You are fortunate in living in a city
in which you can walk along the streets dreaming, without fear of people
disturbing your dream!” And certainly in Madrid it is impossible to walk
along the streets dreaming, not so much for fear of motors, trams and
carriages as because of the continual stream of unknown faces. The
distraction of a great city, so agreeable to those who must have
something, no matter what, to occupy their imagination, is necessarily
vexatious to those whose chief concern is not to have their imagination
diverted. Personally I find nothing more monotonous than a Paris
boulevard. The people seem to me like shadows. I cannot endure a crowd
of unknown faces.</p>

<p>I am afraid of Madrid. That is to say, I am afraid of myself when I go
there. It is easy to say that in great cities everyone can live the life
that suits him best, but it is easier to say it than to do it. When I am
in the capital, I return home every night regretting having gone to the
party or to the meeting that I went to and resolving never to go again,
but only to break my vow the very next day. I am surrounded, hemmed in
and invaded by a lethal atmosphere of compliance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span> an atmosphere that is
generated by this so-called life of society.</p>

<p>I have always felt an aversion from this so-called life of society,
which has for its object the cultivation of social relationships. Is
there anything more terrible than a “call”? It affords an occasion for
the exchange of the most threadbare commonplaces. Calls and the theatre
are the two great centres for the propagation of platitudes.</p>

<p>A man of society, a drawing-room man who can make himself agreeable to
women when he pays a call, is always a man whose principal concern is to
suppress any arresting spontaneity, not to let his own personality show
through. For it is a man’s own personality that people find irritating.
People like to meet the average man, the normal man, the man who has
nothing exceptional about him. The exception is always irritating. How
many times I have heard the terrible phrase: “This man irritates me.”
Yes, it is “the man” that irritates, and the hardest fight for the man
who feels that he is a man is the fight to win respect for his own
individuality.</p>

<p>And in a small town? Its stage is very restricted; the players soon tire
of playing the parts allotted to them and the real men begin to appear
underneath, with all their weaknesses&#8212;that is to say, with precisely
that which makes them men. I have a great liking for provincial life,
for there it is easiest to discern tragedy lurking beneath an appearance
of calm. And just as much as I abhor comedy, I love tragedy. And, above
all, tragi-comedy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span></p>

<p>I have heard it said that there are no such seething intestine rancours
and dissensions as in a merchant vessel or a monastery; that whenever
men are obliged to live together, cut off from the rest of the world,
their personalities, their most real and intimate selves, immediately
clash against one another. And I dare say that this is the only way of
attaining that knowledge of ourselves which ought to be our chief aim.
It seems to me scarcely possible that a man should get to know himself
by shutting himself up in the wilderness, contemplating&#8212;what? The best
way of knowing one’s self is to clash, heart against heart, that is to
say, rock against rock, with one’s fellow.</p>

<p>I know that I shall be told that I am indulging my love of paradox, but
nevertheless I maintain that if it is true that the most ardent
admirations are those which are disguised in the form of envy, very
often the strongest attractions are those which take the appearance of
hate. In one of these tragi-comic, or rather comi-tragic, small towns I
know two men who, though obliged to see one another constantly in the
way of business, never greet one another in the street and profess a
mutual detestation. Nevertheless at bottom they feel themselves
reciprocally attracted to one another and each one is continually
preoccupied by the other.</p>

<p>These irreconcilable feuds into which small towns are so often divided
are much more favourable to the development of strong personalities than
the bland comedy of a great metropolis, where those who fight a duel to
the death on the public stage embrace one<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">{130}</a></span> another behind the scenes. Do
you suppose that the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet is possible in a city
that counts its inhabitants by the million?</p>

<p>And I ask you, do you suppose that anyone who sees a multitude of people
in the course of the day, listens to this man to-day, to another man
to-morrow and to another man the day after, and attends twenty or thirty
conferences&#8212;do you think that such a one can preserve his spiritual
integrity without any leakage? In such a life a hedgehog would end by
becoming a lamb, its quills would turn into softest fleece, and for my
part I would rather be a hedgehog than a lamb.</p>

<p>I understand why Willoughby fled from London as from the burial-place of
the individual man. Is it not a terrible thing to walk through two or
three miles of city streets and pass two or three thousand people
without meeting a single known face to set a spark to a train of human
thought? A glance of hate from a known enemy is sweeter than a glance of
indifference, if not of disdain, from an unknown stranger. For man has
acquired the habit of disdaining those whom he does not know, and seems
to suppose that every stranger must be presumed to be an imbecile until
he proves himself otherwise.</p>

<p>And those who say that they are bored in a small town? The reason is
because they have not dug down to its tragic roots, to the august
severity of the depths of its monotony.</p>

<p>It is my belief that in great cities proud natures become vain, that is
to say, the quills become fleece.</p>

<p>And for the man who is engaged in any kind of work in which he can
exercise his influence from a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">{131}</a></span> for the writer or the painter,
the small town offers the inestimable advantage of enabling him to live
far from his public and of its being possible that the effects which his
work produces either do not reach him or reach him only after a
searching process of filtration. He can live more or less independently
of his public, without allowing himself to be influenced by it, and this
is the only way of making a public for oneself instead of adapting
oneself to it.</p>

<p>If this be the case, it may be urged that a village would be better than
a small town, a hamlet or perhaps even a remote farm-house. But no, for
then there would be lacking that minimum of organic society without
which our personality runs as much risk as it runs in the heart of a
metropolis.</p>

<p>Essentially, in the sphere of psychologico-sociological relations&#8212;this
is for the benefit of those who insist on labelling me savant&#8212;it is a
question of what is perhaps the most fundamental of all problems, the
problem of maxima and minima. This is the problem that is the nerve of
physical mechanics and the nerve also of social mechanics or economics.
The problem always is how to obtain the maximum result or profit with
the minimum effort or expense, the largest return with the least
expenditure. It is also the fundamental problem of æsthetics; it is at
the root of all the problems of life.</p>

<p>And with regard to the subject I am now considering, it is a question of
obtaining the maximum of our own personality with the minimum of others’
society. Less society, or a society less complex, would diminish our
personality, and so also would more society, or a society apparently
more complex. And I say appar<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_132">{132}</a></span>ently, for I am not aware that an elephant
is more complex than a fox.</p>

<p>Very well then&#8212;he who has no sense of his own personality and is
willing to sacrifice it on the altar of sociability, let him go and lose
himself among the millions of a metropolis. For the man who has a
longing for Nirvana the metropolis is better than the desert. If you
want to submerge your own “I,” better the streets of a great city than
the solitudes of the wilderness.</p>

<p>It is not a bad thing now and again to visit the great city and plunge
into the sea of its crowds, but in order to emerge again upon terra
firma and feel the solid ground under one’s feet. For my part, since I
am interested in individuals&#8212;in John and Peter and Richard, in you who
are reading this book&#8212;but not in the masses which they form when banded
together, I remain in the small town, seeing every day at the same hour
the same men, men whose souls have clashed, and sometimes painfully,
with my soul; and I flee from the great metropolis where my soul is
whipped with the icy whips of the disdainful glances of those who know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">{133}</a></span>me not and who are unknown to me. People whom I cannot name ...
horrible!</p>

<h2><a id="TO_MY_READERS"></a>TO MY READERS</h2>

<p>Yes, I know it&#8212;I am not sympathetic to all those who read me, perhaps
not even to the majority of them. But what I am to do?... So long as
they go on reading me.... For the fact is I would rather that they
should find me not sympathetic and nevertheless go on reading me than
that they should find me sympathetic and cease to read me. Sympathy is
often purchased at the cost of authority and respect. I confess that the
quality of being sympathetic does not appear to me to be a very
desirable thing in a writer. It is perhaps the beginning of discredit, a
discredit that is none the less profound because it wears a gilded
disguise.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that I am not sympathetic, that I have perhaps succeeded in
making myself antipathetic to many of those who read me and who in spite
of this antipathy&#8212;or rather because of it&#8212;still continue to read me.</p>

<p>A short time ago a friend wrote to me saying that although he often
disagrees with me he reads me because his reaction to my opinions
stimulates ideas in him. I profess myself well content with this, to
beget ideas in those who read me, although these ideas should be the
contrary of those which I expound and defend.</p>

<p>But there are many, very many readers who don’t like being obliged to
think and who only want to be told what they already know, what they
have already<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_134">{134}</a></span> thought. In order to become sympathetic a writer has only
to flatter and confirm his readers’ preconceptions, clinching the
commonplaces to which their minds have given assent. That is the way for
a writer to become sympathetic and it is also the way for him to become
soon tedious, so that the reader remarks: “Ah, yes, a very sympathetic
writer, very understanding!” and ceases to read him.</p>

<p>Most people&#8212;I have said this more than once before and as I am an
insistent writer, another quality which does not help to make me
sympathetic, I shall have to repeat it many times more&#8212;most people read
in order not to be informed. Yes, literally, not to be informed. The
worthy Fulánez takes the paper or the review at breakfast-time and reads
it as he would listen to a waltz-tune, in order to while away the time.
He dislikes being agitated, he dislikes being contradicted; but most of
all he dislikes being told something that he has never thought of
before.</p>

<p>There is a spiritual pain analogous to physical pain; there is a
spiritual pain when the tissues of the soul are torn away. For just as
the body has its tissues of cells and filaments, so the soul has its
tissues of impressions, memories, sensations and ideas. The breaking of
an association of ideas is like the breaking of an association of bodily
cells and may produce anything from a slight irritation to the most
acute pain.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common observation that the pain which we feel at the
death of someone dear to us, with whom we have lived together, at first
goes on increasing until it reaches a point when it begins to diminish.
Its progress might be described by a rapidly ascending<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_135">{135}</a></span> and gradually
descending curve. The first effect is one of stupor. The pain becomes
most acute when we feel the gap that has been left in our existence,
when we feel the rupture of our associations of ideas and feelings. The
image of the loved one was intimately woven into the spiritual tissue of
our life, and death cannot tear it away without destroying the tissue.</p>

<p>And every rupture of an association of ideas and feelings is accompanied
by a disturbance which varies in degree from the pain that we feel at
the death of a father, husband, wife, brother or son, to the minor
irritation which is caused by the exploding of some commonplace that had
become a habit of our mind. And we writers who are given to breaking
these associations&#8212;and that is why we are called paradoxists&#8212;jar on
people and incur their antipathy. It is our fate.</p>

<p>And they tell us that what jars is not so much what we say as our way of
saying it. Yes, it is because instead of cutting these associations with
surgical delicacy, first chloroforming or hypnotizing the patient, we
tear them roughly and when he is most wide awake. It is a question of
method, and it is a question of temperament. Chloroform, the clinical as
well as the literary variety, has its inconveniences, and there are
cases in which the patient has to suffer pain. To irritate people may
even become a duty binding upon the conscience, a painful duty, but a
duty none the less.</p>

<p>And then there is another thing which makes me antipathetic, I know, and
that is my lack of impersonality, my incapacity to produce what is
called objective work, my putting my whole self, more or less, into all
my writings, my egotism, as it is called. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span> what am I to do?... I am
amazed at those who are able to eliminate their own selves, I am amazed,
but I don’t imitate them and I don’t wish to imitate them.</p>

<p>I don’t know how it may be elsewhere, but here in Spain the man, the
individual man, irritates us. And as I believe that the great battle is
how to win respect for man, respect for individuality, I for my part
irritate the myriad-headed, anonymous multitude. Let them respect me.
Thus they will learn to respect every individual, to respect themselves
as individuals.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is quite right to use one’s knowledge with discretion, just
as it is quite right to use one’s wealth with discretion. But neither
knowledge nor wealth is one’s self; they are something annexed,
something that comes and goes, that can be taken or left. But I cannot
make a discreet use of myself. If I am deprived of a shilling or a
dollar I can submit to it, but I cannot easily submit to being deprived
of an arm or, still less, of a piece of my soul. A shilling or a dollar
I can give away discreetly, but an arm or a piece of my soul, these I
can only tear off and give away passionately, that is to say
indiscreetly. And I do not give ideas, I do not give knowledge&#8212;I give
pieces of my soul. The ideas that I expound matter to me less, far less,
than the way I expound them.</p>

<p>It is not the shilling that I give you that counts, but the warmth that
it carries with it from my hand.</p>

<p>These antipathies that I provoke proceed&#8212;as well I know, in spite of
whatever those who see only the surface may say&#8212;from the fact that I am
not an intellectual but a man of passion. Almost all the things that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span> I
have said, hundreds, thousands, have said before me. I am neither
erudite nor a savant. There is no great originality in my ideas. Whence,
then, the potency which, thanks to God, I have attained? Whence these
antipathies and sympathies, and how is it that I am able to say, thanks
to God, that I am seldom read with indifference?&#8212;It is due to passion,
to the tone of my voice.</p>

<p>Yes, I know it, I am antipathetic to many of my readers, and one of the
things that makes me most antipathetic to them is my aggressiveness, my
sometimes morbid aggressiveness. I don’t deny it. But the truth is, my
friend, that this aggressiveness is directed against myself. When I
attack others I am attacking myself. I live in a state of inward
conflict. I imagine that I am misinterpreted? Very likely, since I
myself do not always succeed in interpreting myself aright. The ideas
that crowd in upon me from all quarters are always battling together in
my mind and I fail to make peace between them. I fail because I don’t
even try. I need these battles.</p>

<p>And, moreover I am not anxious for a reputation among scholars, for I am
not a scholar, I am not what is called a scholar. Nor even among men of
culture, although I am always preaching culture. But by culture I
understand the most intense inner life, the life of intensest battle, of
intensest disquietude, of intensest desire. I come of a race which some
people say is still, in its essence, in a state of savagery, a race of a
turbulent and taciturn spirit, a race of which Salmerón said that it had
not yet adapted itself to European civilization. And so far as I myself
and my own branch of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">{138}</a></span> the race<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are concerned, I accept this judgment
and I accept it with pride.</p>

<p>No, no, friend, I am not a philanthropist. The hunger and thirst for God
are too strong within me for me to love men in the philanthropic way.
Needs must be sown among men germs of doubt, of distrust, of inquietude,
and even of despair&#8212;why not? yes, even of despair&#8212;and if thereby they
lose what they call happiness, since it is not really happiness, they
have lost nothing.</p>

<p>And above all and before all, none of this living in peace with all the
world! Living in peace with all the world&#8212;horrible, horrible, horrible!
No, no, no, none of this living in peace. Peace, spiritual peace I mean,
is usually a lie and is usually stagnation. I do not wish to live in
peace either with others or with myself. I need war, inward war. We all
need war.</p>

<p>Truth before peace. That is my watchword. And to give it greater
brilliance I will write it in Latin: <i>veritas primus pace</i>. And it goes
without saying that the war that I need as the sustenance of my life and
of the lives of others is a spiritual war, not war with gun and sword.</p>

<p>All the rest&#8212;in spite of whatever the champions of the central current
of culture and of disciplined solidarity and of respect for the
so-called definitive conquests of the human spirit may say&#8212;all the rest
I understand and I am even ready to applaud it if you like; but it is
not my concern, it is not my lot to put myself at its service.</p>

<p>And above all, my friend, there is one thing that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">{139}</a></span> have hated all my
life and that I hope to die hating, and that is, becoming the prisoner
of my public, submitting to follow the course marked out for me by my
readers. I will not sacrifice my independence, above all I will not
mortgage my future. You understand? I will not mortgage my future. I
will keep it open and free.</p>

<p>And so I alienate sympathy?... Who knows? What I want to avoid is public
indifference. Sympathies and antipathies are perhaps the same thing.
Antipathy&#8212;now for a paradox!&#8212;is a form of sympathy. Reading me for the
sake of being annoyed and quarrelling with what I say or my way of
saying it, is the same as reading me and agreeing with what I say. To
combat a man is one way of animating and confirming him.</p>

<p>I have put warmth and life into my books and it is for the sake of the
warmth and life I have put into them that you read them. I have put
passion into my books. Passion of hate, passion of disdain, passion of
contempt very often&#8212;I don’t deny it. But does warmth come only from
this thing that they call love and which, ninety times out of a hundred,
is nothing but drivelling mawkishness and debility of spirit? And I have
put my loves into my books too, those loves which beget my indignations,
those loves which are the cause of my being so often harsh, severe,
disdainful. Yes, love makes me antipathetic, a greater and purer love
than that delusive sympathy which some people urge me to seek after.</p>

<p>Never, never, never! Let such apostleship be for others. Every man has
his own destiny.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>And this is not a presumption of superiority. No, don’t think that. If
you suspect such a thing it is because you don’t know me. No, it is not
that. I don’t condemn your opinion; I don’t regard the advice you give
me as bad; I only say that it is no use to me. I tell you that you are
mistaken about me. And not because you lack intelligence, no, a thousand
times no. You are mistaken because each of us sets out from a different
point of view, or rather from a different point of feeling. You appear
to me to be an optimist, or at any rate a man who believes that progress
will alleviate the pains of mankind; you speak with a certain unction of
the noble crusade of thought and of the great enterprise of culture, and
I believe that the best that this enterprise can do is to make us forget
that we have been born and that we have to die. I confess that I have a
tragic sense of life. I confess it without petulance or pedantry, and I
know that you will not doubt my sincerity.</p>

<p>This bitterness that you find so disagreeable in my writings has grown
with being exercised against myself. I am the sword and the whetstone
and I sharpen my sword on myself. Hence it is that I am as tired with
the sword-play as I am with sharpening the sword that I play with.</p>

<p>And if I am to tell you the truth, it hurts and wounds me to see men
marching as confidently as if they marched on solid ground, some
confident in the prejudices and anti-prejudices of their religious
beliefs, others slaves of science, others slaves of ignorance, slaves
all of them. I would have them doubt, I would have them suffer, above
all I would have them despair,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_141">{141}</a></span> I would have them be men and not mere
partisans of the party of progress. Despair, even though it be a
resigned despair, is perhaps the highest state that man can attain to.</p>

<p>God, friend, did not send me into the world to be an apostle of peace,
or to reap sympathy, but to be a sower of disquietude and irritation and
to endure antipathy. Antipathy is the price of my redemption.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">{142}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="SOLILOQUIES"></a>SOLILOQUIES</h2>

<p>I</p>

<p>It would seem, Miguel, that your audience will have to allow you, if
only just for once, to talk aloud to yourself, to unburden your
heart.&#8212;Do it now, and then it will be all the easier to do it again
some other day.&#8212;Writing for the public is a harsh kind of slavery.</p>

<p>Doubtless you willed it. You chose to be a writer and you must patiently
bear the consequences of your choice. But are we as free to choose our
vocation as we think we are?</p>

<p>You crave retirement, tranquillity and silence in order that you may
devote yourself to some solid and unhurried task, remote from the
turmoil that deafens the ear with its noise and blinds the eye with its
dust. Your heart with its yearning for solitude turns longingly towards
those men of old who dedicated themselves to works that endure, far from
the traffic of the world with its daily contentions and anxieties. You
yearn for the classic, the eternally classic. But the vertigo of life
sweeps you along and you find yourself involved in the burning
dissensions of your contemporaries. You cannot live among the dead; you
have to live among the living.</p>

<p>And yet, dear Miguel, what a source of consolation and strength is this
intercourse with the glorious dead, whose works never die! How the soul
is refreshed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">{143}</a></span> the vivifying streams that flow from those immortal
spirits who live their deepest lives in us&#8212;Homer, Plato, Virgil, St.
Augustine, Shakespeare, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Goethe, and so many
others!</p>

<p>Yes, there is no doubt about it&#8212;this insane eagerness to know what
those round about us are saying or repeating hinders us from following
the progress of the human soul as it reveals itself in its immortal
sons, those erect pillars that are landmarks for all time. What does it
matter to you, tell me, what your neighbour is clamouring about? You are
not going to follow the example of those whose time and soul are so
absorbed in listening to all the superficialities of their
contemporaries that they have no time left to enjoy the enduring legacy
of humanity. This form of modernity serves only to enfeeble both men and
peoples. Distrust novelties, Miguel, and be sure that there is nothing
more novel than what is for ever. Homer and Shakespeare are more modern
than most of the living writers who are accounted most modern. You will
learn more from Plato than from the author of the latest volume in
Alcan’s Library of Modern Philosophy. The modern is the fashionable and
you must fly from all fashions.</p>

<p>But it is useless&#8212;I know it&#8212;useless. I can see that the voices round
about you, the ardent voices of the living, have caught your ear,
perhaps in spite of yourself. It is the voice of humanity, and you are
and ought to be before all else a man. Do you remember what your dead
friend Coleridge, the wonderful Coleridge, says in his <i>Biographia
Literaria</i> about his contemporaries? I will repeat it to you again:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The great works of past ages seem to a young man things of another
race, in respect to which his faculties must remain passive and
submiss, even as to the stars and mountains. But the writings of a
contemporary, perhaps not many years older than himself, surrounded
by the same circumstances, and disciplined by the same manners,
possess a reality for him, and inspire an actual friendship as of a
man for a man. His very admiration is the wind which fans his hope.
The poems themselves assume the properties of flesh and blood. To
recite, to extol, to contend for them is but the payment of a debt
due to one who exists to receive it.”</p></div>

<p>Consider this same Samuel Taylor Coleridge who wrote these words and
tell me if the memory of this man who died many years before you were
born can give you that glow which the recollection of one still living
gives you. And nevertheless, you will say, how sweet and peaceful it is
to converse with those who once were and to-day sleep in the lap of the
teeming earth.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>You have dreamed of producing a <i>magnum opus</i> that would endure, and you
find yourself condemned to the fragmentary and fugitive labour of
journalism. Must you repine at that? We never know, believe me, when we
have succeeded best.</p>

<p>And remember that the slowly and carefully elaborated work of the
solitary author, holding himself aloof from all collaboration with his
public, is perhaps after all only the monument of his own egoism.</p>

<p>Collaboration with the public, I say. For the public collaborates more
or less ostensibly in the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">{145}</a></span> of every publicist, sometimes with
applause, sometimes with censure. I know that you have been influenced
in your work by the letters which from time to time you receive from
unknown readers, especially from those in America, and which have
provided you with helpful notes and suggestions. But in addition to
this, you are influenced, perhaps without knowing it, by the reaction of
your readers, of those who follow your work, and this reaction affects
what you write, forcing you sometimes to adapt yourself to your readers’
point of view, sometimes to combat it and endeavour to make it conform
to yours.</p>

<p>It is said that some of the greatest dramas, among others those of
Shakespeare, have been actually created on the stage, in collaboration
with the public, having been modified at every representation according
to the way in which the public received them. And do you not think that
the successive works of a productive author are not very often merely
successive editions, more or less revised, of one and the same work?</p>

<p>Every author who writes much repeats himself much; the more original he
is and the more he draws from his own depths instead of merely echoing
what he hears round about him, the more he repeats himself. The greatest
geniuses have been men of few and simple ideas expressed with vigour and
efficacy, but expressed also with more uniformity and continuity than
those of writers of only average ability. There have been men whose
greatness has been owing to the fact that they were men of one idea, men
who were simply an idea incarnate. By dint of living one single but
noble and fruitful idea, they have succeeded in presenting it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">{146}</a></span> to us in
all its forms. Variety, multiplicity of points of view, almost always
indicates a certain spiritual weakness. But I do not need to convince
you of this, for I know how much you admire Athanasius for being a man
of one idea.</p>

<p>Yes, your own works, in spite of their apparent variety&#8212;novels,
commentaries, essays, poems&#8212;are, if you consider it carefully, simply
the continuous development in multiple forms of but one and the same
fundamental idea. And in thus seeking to communicate this central
thought of yours, you go on condensing it more and more and discovering
new forms of expression for it, until perhaps some day you will hit upon
the most adequate, the most precise form. And, believe me, a writer
achieves a lasting place when he has discovered the permanent form of
any idea, when he has succeeded in giving it its definitive body. And in
your effort to discover this, who shall say that this writing of
fugitive and fragmentary pieces is not as useful as any other way of
search? You know that very often one thinks more when talking than when
meditating.</p>

<p>Do you remember that experience which occurred to you one afternoon when
you were walking with your friend Vincent, that wise and subtle spirit,
so unhappily cut off in his prime? You were arguing as usual; his subtle
objections forced you to concentrate your mind, and after a quick reply
to one of his questions, almost before the words were out of your mouth,
you exclaimed delightedly: “How right that is! how exact! how precise!”
And when he showed surprise that you should be astonished by one of your
own remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_147">{147}</a></span> you said: “The fact is, it is as new to me as it is to
you. Doubtless the solution was already there in my mind, but it was dim
and confused. I myself was not conscious of its being there. It was only
in the effort to meet your objections that it took shape and disclosed
itself to me. And so you see it was really as new to me as to you.”</p>

<p>And so it often happens. Thought depends upon language, for we think
with words, and language is a social thing. Language is conversation.
And thought itself is therefore social. The only clear thought is
transmissible thought. If anyone tells you that he sees a thing quite
clearly but that he does not know how to communicate it, you may reply
that he cannot be sure whether he sees it clearly or not. To every
writer it has happened more than once that he has realized the absurdity
or obscurity of his own thought only after he has seen it in print.</p>

<p>Be assured, then, that you meditate more and meditate better when you
are writing things like this letter that you are now addressing to
yourself than when you shut yourself up in your room to devote yourself
to what is called meditation and what is really only mind-wandering. The
necessity of giving your thought transmissible expression is that which
makes it a living and effective process. It is when your pen is in your
hand that things occur to you most readily, and the reason is because
then you are not thinking for yourself but thinking for others. Thinking
for oneself is not properly thinking&#8212;it is losing oneself in vague
reveries, like a man on the verge of sleep idly watching the drift<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span> of
his cigar-smoke. To think is to think for others; thinking is a social
function.</p>

<p>You have sometimes heard it said that Paul of Tarsus used to draw
inspiration from his own words, that these words provoked ideas, and
that in his epistles it is possible to follow this process of ideation
by means of verbal associations. And of Augustine of Hippo&#8212;one of the
immortal pillars, like Paul, Bernard and Martin Luther, of the
Christianity of the heart&#8212;it has been said that he developed his theme
by antitheses, that is to say rhetorically. And both Paul and Augustine
were men of burning passion, not solitary contemplatives, but active
fighters.</p>

<p>They consider you to be an egotist because you often refer to
yourself&#8212;you are doing it now in this soliloquy&#8212;and talk about
yourself, but the truth is that this self of yours, in so far as you are
a writer, is something that belongs to all the world&#8212;you stand in the
middle of the street, hailed by everybody and answering back. You would
be not merely an egotist but a miserable egoist if you shut yourself up
in the tower of ivory, far from your fellows, and worked day after day
upon some minute and exquisite jewel. You work in the open air, in the
public gaze, and from time to time, in order to keep your work clean,
you blow away the dust of the turmoil that has settled upon it.</p>

<p>Enough. Let us talk no more together, you and I, this hidden and
intimate self and this apparent and public self. Are they really two?
Are you anything else but a writer? Or rather, this self that is not the
publicist, of what worth is it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<p>II</p>

<p>It appears to be the fact that many people believe me to be a man who
lives shut up in a library, buried among books, isolated from the world.
They say that I lack what they call the sense of reality. As for the
first charge, that I spend my days devouring books, it is a pure
fiction. I travel more than I wish to travel and I see more people than
I wish to see. With regard to the second, my lack of the sense of
reality&#8212;let us consider it.</p>

<p>That which men of the world&#8212;and in my speech and writings I always use
this phrase in a sufficiently depreciatory sense&#8212;that which men of the
world call the sense of reality appears to me to be no more than a sense
of apparentiality. A man is said to possess the sense of reality who
stops to consider only the transient surface of things and does not
penetrate into their permanent substance.</p>

<p>Those who are said to possess this sense of reality are interested only
in news, what is called the latest information. And as for me&#8212;I must
say it perfectly frankly&#8212;I detest the latest information. There is
nothing in the newspaper that strikes me as so empty as the page devoted
to the latest news. This craving to have news, news usually lacking in
any deep import, as quickly as possible, seems to me puerile. The
important thing, I have always supposed, is to know things thoroughly,
not to know them quickly.</p>

<p>But the current runs in the other direction. For one who reads a book
with the sole purpose of knowing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_150">{150}</a></span> enjoying and profiting by it, there
are twenty who read it simply in order to say that they have read it and
to gain kudos by quoting from it.</p>

<p>There are, or at any rate there ought to be, in each one of us two men,
the temporal and the eternal, the one who is preoccupied with the cares
of the passing day and the one who is preoccupied with the eternal
preoccupations, the one who says: “What shall I eat, or how shall I
amuse myself to-morrow?” and the one who says: “What will happen to us
after death?” In some cases the inner man dominates and leads captive
the external man and then the individual either retires to a monastery
or he lives a life of resigned despair, ceaseless wrestling with
mystery; and in some cases the external and temporal man subjugates and
strangles the inner and eternal man, and then we have the man of the
world, the man who boasts of being practical and of possessing the sense
of reality. And this practical man does not interest me in the least.</p>

<p>When I find myself in a modern city, in one of these cities that are
called progressive because of their system of police and hygiene, with
smoothly paved streets, pretentious buildings, electric trams, luxurious
motors replete with fashionably dressed women, well-kept parks,
comfortable clubs, theatres&#8212;in short, complete with all the apparatus
of a modern city&#8212;whenever I find myself in such a city I am enveloped,
invaded and oppressed by a sense of profound and utter solitude. The men
appear to me like shadows without substance. And like Diogenes I begin
to look for a man, a real man, a man who wrestles with destiny and
mystery, a man of religious spirit, a man, in short, who believes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
God or denies Him, but who believes in Him or denies Him passionately,
with the heart, not merely in virtue of some philosophical formula
forming part of the general knowledge that a well-educated man is
expected to possess.</p>

<p>I set about looking for a man ... and rarely, very rarely, do I find
him. “The man you ought to know is López,” they tell me, “a man of
culture and distinction.” And so, although without any illusion, and
chiefly in order not to offend the friend who recommends him to me, I
get to know López. And in effect López has read a great deal and knows
the names of the most prominent writers and publicists and discusses
Comte and Spencer and Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and has read the
latest French novelists, and knows several famous passages of poetry by
heart and has his tincture of history, sociology, psychology and natural
science, and López ... is not the man I am looking for.</p>

<p>It is not the great classic authors that López has read, the essential
geniuses, the men who have gazed at the Sphinx face to face, but rather
their expositors and commentators; he knows the great minds of all time
as they are reflected in manuals of the history of philosophy or
literature. Once perhaps, not so much even for curiosity’s sake as to be
able to say that he has read them, he has looked into the book of Job or
St. Augustine or Pascal or à Kempis, but his heart has not been touched.
And naturally López does not interest me, does not even appear to me to
be a man; he is simply a member of a club, or a member of Parliament, or
a brilliant figure in polite society. His dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_152">{152}</a></span>tinction is of the same
category as that of his wife’s mediocre facility in playing the piano.
López knows how to present himself to the best advantage.</p>

<p>But fortunately and thanks to God I do not live in one of these cities,
which are all alike, all attempting to imitate Paris. I live in an
ancient city, whose age is perpetual youth, whose golden stones distil
memories. And even so, whenever I can I escape into the country and
there I talk with some old shepherd who has brooded for long hours
beneath the sky upon eternal themes. And this man who reads no
newspapers, who does not know where Serbia is and has never heard of
Dreyfus or Anatole France or the Kaiser, who knows nothing about the
latest sociological theory or the latest fashion in morning coats, this
man speaks to me the ancient words of the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. And as
he has never read Ecclesiastes, but has derived his wisdom from the same
fount, the ancient words come to me new, eternally new.</p>

<p>Many times I have wished in my secret heart that I had lived in one of
those ages of burning faith, among a people consumed by an infinite
passion, among the Crusaders or among the Albigenses, in the ranks of
Cromwell’s Ironsides or of Coligny’s Huguenots, or in the obscurity of
the monastery in which Heinrich Seuss underwent his tremendous
mortifications.... But who in God’s name, if he be a man and a real man,
can stand one of those banquets with which the friends of the
distinguished López celebrate the honour of his being appointed governor
of a province, with their interminable toasts, all full of the same
empty platitudes, pronounced to the hateful accompaniment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_153">{153}</a></span>
popping of champagne corks? When the unavoidable exigencies of social
servitude compel me to attend one of these ceremonies of homage, I feel
a desire to get up and say: “Brothers, let us meditate upon death!” and
launch forth into a sermon. I don’t do so, of course, though not for
fear of ridicule, but because I know that it would avail nothing.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>But enough of unbosoming myself. You needn’t be afraid, I know that I am
a slave, I know that we are all slaves.... I will return to the beaten
track, I will return to “objective” themes, but.... But must my heart
never be allowed the relief of a sigh, a sigh at once of resignation and
rebellion? Must I not be allowed some time to say that all this that you
call civilization appears to me to be nothing but the trappings of
culture and that those who are content merely with the trappings are
savages muffled in royal robes, and that the splendour of your
metropolises leaves me cold?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_154">{154}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="MY_RELIGION"></a>MY RELIGION</h2>

<p>A friend writing to me from Chile tells me that he has met people
acquainted with my writings who have asked him: “What, in a word, is the
religion of this Señor Unamuno?” I myself have several times been asked
a similar question. And I am going to see if I cannot&#8212;I will not say,
answer it, for that is a thing I do not pretend to be able to do, but
endeavour at any rate to elucidate the meaning of the question.</p>

<p>Individuals as well as peoples characterized by intellectual
inertia&#8212;and intellectual inertia is quite compatible with great
productive activity in the sphere of economics and in other kindred
spheres&#8212;tend to dogmatism, whether they know it or not, whether they
wish it or not, whether they intend it or not. Intellectual inertia
shuns the critical or sceptical attitude.</p>

<p>I say sceptical, taking the word scepticism in its etymological and
philosophical sense, for the sceptic does not mean him who doubts, but
him who investigates or researches, as opposed to him who asserts and
thinks that he has found. The one is the man who studies a problem and
the other is the man who gives us a formula, correct or incorrect, as
the solution of it.</p>

<p>In the order of pure philosophical speculation it is premature to demand
that an investigator shall produce a definite solution of a problem
while he is engaged in defining the problem itself more exactly. When a
long<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_155">{155}</a></span> calculation does not work out correctly, it is no small step
forward to rub it all out and begin afresh. When a house threatens to
collapse or becomes completely uninhabitable, the first thing to do is
to pull it down and not to demand that another shall be built on top of
it. The new house may indeed be built with materials taken from the old
one, but only after the old one has first been demolished. In the
meantime, if there is no other house available, the people can find
shelter in a hut or sleep in the open.</p>

<p>And it is necessary not to lose sight of the fact that in the problems
of practical life we must seldom expect to find definite scientific
solutions. Men live and always have lived upon hazardous hypotheses and
explanations, and sometimes even without them. Men have not waited to
agree as to whether or not the criminal was possessed of free will
before punishing him, and a man does not pause before sneezing to
reflect upon the possible injury that may be caused by the obstructing
particle that provokes him to sneeze.</p>

<p>I think that those men are mistaken who assert that they would live
evilly if they did not believe in the eternal pains of hell, and the
mistake is all to their credit. If they ceased to believe in a sanction
after death, they would not live worse, but they would look for some
other ideal justification for their conduct. The good man is not good
because he believes in a transcendental order, but rather he believes in
it because he is good&#8212;a proposition which I am sure must appear obscure
or involved to those inquirers who suffer from intellectual inertia.</p>

<p>I am asked, then: “What is your religion?” And<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_156">{156}</a></span> I will reply: My
religion is to seek truth in life and life in truth, even though knowing
full well that I shall never find them so long as I live; my religion is
to wrestle unceasingly and unwearyingly with mystery; my religion is to
wrestle with God from nightfall until the breaking of the day, as Jacob
is said to have wrestled with Him. I cannot accommodate myself to the
doctrine of the Unknowable or to that of “thus far and no farther.” I
reject the everlasting <i>Ignorabimus</i>. And at all hazards I seek to scale
the unattainable.</p>

<p>“Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect,” Christ said to us, and
such an ideal of perfection is, without doubt, unattainable. But He put
the unattainable before us as the goal and term of our endeavours. And
He attained to it, say the theologians, by grace. And I wish to fight my
fight careless of victory. Are there not armies and even peoples who
march to certain defeat? Do we not praise those who die fighting rather
than surrender? This, then, is my religion.</p>

<p>Those who put this question to me want me to give them a dogma, a
solution which they can accept without disturbing their mental inertia.
Or rather it is not this that they want, so much as to be able to label
me and put me into one of the divisions in which they classify minds, so
that they can say of me: He is a Lutheran, a Calvanist, a Catholic, an
atheist, a rationalist, a mystic, or any other of those nicknames whose
exact meaning they do not understand but which dispense them from
further thinking. And I do not wish to have myself labelled, for I,
Miguel de Unamuno, like every other man who aspires to full
consciousness, am a unique species. “There are no diseases, but only<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_157">{157}</a></span>
persons who are diseased,” some doctors say, and I say that there are no
opinions, but only opining persons.</p>

<p>In religion there is but little that is capable of rational resolution,
and as I do not possess that little I cannot communicate it logically,
for only the rational is logical and transmissible. I have, it is true,
so far as my affections, my heart and my feelings are concerned, a
strong bent towards Christianity, but without adhering to the special
dogmas of this or that Christian confession. I count every man a
Christian who invokes the name of Christ with respect and love, and I am
repelled by the orthodox, whether Catholic or Protestant&#8212;the latter
being usually as intransigent as the former&#8212;who deny the Christianity
of those who interpret the Gospel differently from themselves. I know a
Protestant Christian who denies that Unitarians are Christians.</p>

<p>I frankly confess that the supposed rational proofs&#8212;ontological,
cosmological, ethical, etc.&#8212;of the existence of God, prove to me
nothing; that all the reasons adduced to show that a God exists appear
to me to be based on sophistry and begging of the question. In this I am
with Kant. And in discussions of this kind, I feel that I am unable to
talk to cobblers in the terms of their craft.</p>

<p>Nobody has succeeded in convincing me rationally of the existence of
God, nor yet of His non-existence; the arguments of atheists appear to
me even more superficial and futile than those of their opponents. And
if I believe in God, or at least believe that I believe in Him, it is,
first of all, because I wish that God may exist, and then, because He is
revealed to me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_158">{158}</a></span> through the channel of the heart, in the Gospel and in
Christ and in history. It is an affair of the heart.</p>

<p>Which means that I am not convinced of it as I am of the fact that two
and two make four.</p>

<p>If it were a question of something that did not touch my peace of
conscience or console me for having been born, perhaps I should pay no
heed to the problem; but as it involves my whole interior life and the
spring of all my actions, I cannot quiet myself by saying: I do not know
nor can I know. I do not know, that is certain; perhaps I can never
know. But I want to know. I want to, and that is enough.</p>

<p>And I shall spend my life wrestling with mystery, and even without hope
of penetrating it, for this wrestling is my sustenance and my
consolation. Yes, my consolation. I have accustomed myself to wrest hope
from despair itself. And let not fools in their superficiality shriek:
Paradox!</p>

<p>I cannot conceive of a man of culture without this preoccupation, and in
point of culture&#8212;and culture is not the same as civilization&#8212;I can
hope but little from those who live without interest in the metaphysical
aspect of the religious problem, and only study it in its social or
political aspects. I can hope but very little for the enrichment of the
spiritual treasury of mankind from those men or from those peoples who,
whether it be from intellectual inertia, or from superficiality, or from
scientificism, or from any other cause, are unmoved by the great and
eternal disquietudes of the heart. I can hope nothing from those who
say: “We must not think about these things!” I can hope even less from
those who believe in a heaven and a hell<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_159">{159}</a></span> such as those which we
believed in when we were children; and still less can I hope from those
who affirm with a fool’s gravity: “All this is but myth and fable; he
who dies is buried and there’s an end of it.” I can hope for something
only from those who do not know, but who are not resigned not to know;
from those who fight unrestingly for the truth and put their life in the
fight itself rather than in the victory.</p>

<p>The greater part of my work has always been to disquiet my neighbours,
to rob them of heart’s ease, to vex them if I can. I have said this
already in my commentary upon “The Life of Don Quixote and Sancho,” in
which I have confessed myself most fully. Let them seek as I seek, let
them wrestle as I wrestle, and between us all we will tear some shred of
secret from God, and at any rate this wrestling will make us more men,
men of more spirit.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this work&#8212;a religious work&#8212;among peoples like
those that speak the Castilian tongue who suffer from intellectual
inertia and superficiality, slumbering in the routine of Catholic dogma
or in the dogmatism of free-thought or of scientificism, it has been
necessary for me to appear sometimes shameless and indecorous, at other
times harsh and aggressive, and not a few times perverse and
paradoxical. In our pusillanimous literature it was a rare thing to hear
anyone cry out from the depths of his heart, to get excited, to exclaim.
The shout was almost unknown. Writers were frightened of making
themselves ridiculous. They behaved and still behave like those who put
up with an affront in the street for fear of the ridicule of being seen
with their hat on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span> ground marched off by the police. But I, no! When
I have felt like shouting I have shouted. Never have I been restrained
by decorum. And this is one of the things for which I have never been
forgiven by my colleagues of the pen, so discreet, so correct, so
disciplined, even when they preach indiscretion and indiscipline.
Literary anarchists are more punctilious about style and syntax than
about anything else. And when they play out of tune they do so
tunefully; their discords resolve themselves into harmonies.</p>

<p>When I have felt a pain I have shouted and shouted in public. The psalms
which are to be found in my <i>Poesías</i> are simply the cries from the
heart with which I have sought to make the heart-strings of the wounded
hearts of others vibrate. If they have no heart-strings or only
heart-strings that are too rigid to vibrate, then my cry will awaken no
echo in them and they will declare that it is not poetry and they will
proceed to investigate its acoustic properties. It is possible also to
study acoustically the cry that is torn from the heart of a man who sees
his son suddenly fall down dead&#8212;and he who has neither heart nor sons
will understand no more of it than the acoustics.</p>

<p>These psalms, together with various other pieces in my <i>Poesías</i>, are my
religion, a religion that I have sung, not expressed in logic and
reasoning. And I sing it as best I can, with the voice and ear that God
has given me, because I cannot reason it. And he to whom my verses
appear to be more full of reasoning and logic and method and exegesis
than of life, because they are not peopled with fauns, dryads, satyrs
and the like or garbed in the latest modernist fashion, had better<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_161">{161}</a></span>
leave them alone, for it is evident that I shall not touch his heart
whether I use a violin bow or a hammer.</p>

<p>What I fly from, I repeat, as from the plague, is any kind of
classification of myself, and when I die I hope I shall still hear these
intellectual sluggards inquiring: “And this gentleman, what is he?”
Liberal or progressive fools will take me for a reactionary and perhaps
for a mystic, without understanding of course what they may mean; and
conservative and reactionary fools will take me for a kind of spiritual
anarchist; and both of them will pity me as an unfortunate gentleman
anxious to distinguish himself by singularity, hoping to be reputed an
original, and with a bonnet full of bees. But no one need worry about
what fools think of him, be they progressive or conservative, liberal or
reactionary.</p>

<p>And since man is naturally intractable, and does not habitually thirst
for the truth, and after being preached at for four hours usually
returns to all his inveterate habits, these busy inquirers, if they
chance to read this, will return to me with the question: “Well, but
what solutions do you offer?” And I will tell them, once and for all,
that if it is solutions they want, they can go to the shop opposite, for
I do not deal in the article. My earnest desire has been, is and will be
that those who read me should think and meditate on fundamental things,
and it has never been to furnish them with thoughts ready made. I have
always sought to agitate and to suggest rather than to instruct. It is
not bread that I sell, not bread, but yeast, ferment.</p>

<p>I have friends, and good friends, who advise me to abandon this task and
to concentrate upon what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_162">{162}</a></span> call some objective work, something which
will be, so they express it, definitive, something constructive,
something that will last. They mean something dogmatic. I declare that I
am incapable of it, and I claim my liberty, my holy liberty, even, if
need be, the liberty of contradicting myself. I do not know whether
anything that I have written or may write in the future is destined to
live for years and centuries after I am dead; but I know that if anyone
agitates the surface of a shoreless sea the waves will go radiating
without end, even though at last they dwindle into ripples. To agitate
is something. And if thanks to this agitation another who comes after me
shall create something that will live, then my work will live in his.</p>

<p>It is a work of supreme mercy to awaken the sleeper and to shake the
sluggard, and it is a work of supreme religious piety to seek truth in
everything and to expose fraud, stupidity and ignorance wherever they
are to be found.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_163">{163}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="SOLITUDE"></a>SOLITUDE</h2>

<p>It is my love for the multitude that makes me fly from them. In flying
from them, I go on seeking them. Do not call me a misanthrope.
Misanthropes seek society and intercourse with people; they need them in
order to feed their hatred and disdain of them. Love can live upon
memories and hopes; hate needs present realities.</p>

<p>Let me, then, fly from society and take refuge in the quiet of the
country, seeking in the heart of it and within my own soul the company
of people.</p>

<p>Men only feel themselves really brothers when they hear one another in
the silence of things in the midst of solitude. The hushed moan of your
neighbour which reaches you through the wall that separates you
penetrates much more deeply into your heart than would all his laments
if he told you them to your face. I shall never forget a night that I
once spent at a watering-place, during the whole of which I was kept
awake by a very faint intermittent moaning&#8212;a moaning that seemed to
wish to stifle itself in order not to awaken those who were asleep, a
discreet and gentle moaning that came to me from the neighbouring
bedroom. That moaning, which came from I know not whom, had lost all
personality; it produced upon me the illusion of coming out of the
silence of the night itself, as if it were the silence or the night
that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">{164}</a></span> lamented, and there was even a moment when I dreamt that that
gentle lament rose to the surface from the depths of my own soul.</p>

<p>I left the following day without having sought to ascertain who was the
sufferer or why he suffered. And I believe that I have never felt so
much pity for any other man.</p>

<p>It is only solitude that dissolves that thick cloak of shame that
isolates us from one another; only in solitude do we find ourselves; and
in finding ourselves, we find in ourselves all our brothers in solitude.
Solitude unites us, believe me, just as much as society separates us.
And if we do not know how to love one another, it is because we do not
know how to be alone.</p>

<p>It is only in solitude, when it has broken the thick crust of shame that
separates us from one another and separates us all from God, that we
have no secrets from God; only in solitude do we raise our heart to the
Heart of the Universe; only in solitude does the redeeming hymn of
supreme confession issue from our soul.</p>

<p>There is no other real dialogue than the dialogue that you hold with
yourself, and you can hold this dialogue only when you are alone. In
solitude and only in solitude can you know yourself as a neighbour; and
so long as you do not know yourself as a neighbour, you can never hope
to see in your neighbours other I’s. If you want to learn to love
others, withdraw into yourself.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>I am accused of not caring about or being interested in the anxieties of
men. It is just the contrary. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_165">{165}</a></span> am convinced that there is no more than
one anxiety, one and the same for all men, and never do I feel it or
understand it more deeply than when I am alone. Each day I believe less
and less in the social question, and in the political question, and in
the æsthetic question, and in the moral question, and in the religious
question, and in all the other questions that people have invented in
order that they shall not have to face resolutely the only real question
that exists&#8212;the human question, which is mine, yours, his, everyone’s.</p>

<p>And as I know that you will say that I am playing with words and that
you will ask me what I mean by this human question, I shall have to
repeat it once again: The human question is the question of knowing what
is to become of my consciousness, of yours, of his, of everyone’s, after
each one of us has died. So long as we are not facing this question, all
that we are doing is simply making a noise so that we shall not hear it.
And that is why we fear solitude so much and seek the company of one
another.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The greatest thing that there is among men is a poet, a lyric poet, that
is to say a real poet. A poet is a man who keeps no secrets from God in
his heart, and who, in singing his griefs, his fears, his hopes and his
memories, purifies and purges them from all falsehood. His songs are
your songs, are my songs.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard any deeper, any more intimate, any more enduring
poetry than that of the Psalms? And the Psalms are meant for singing
alone. I know that they are sung by crowds, assembled together under the
same roof in religious services; but in singing them<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">{166}</a></span> the crowd ceases
to be a crowd. In singing the Psalms, each one withdraws into himself
and the voices of others echo in his ears simply as the consonance and
reinforcement of his own voice.</p>

<p>And I observe this difference between a crowd assembled together to sing
the Psalms and a crowd assembled to see a drama or to hear an orator: it
is that the former is a real society, a company of living souls, in
which each one exists and subsists by himself, while the other is a
formless mass and each one of those who compose it no more than a
fragment of the human herd.</p>

<p>I have never felt any desire to move a crowd, to exercise influence upon
a mass of people&#8212;who lose their personality in being massed
together&#8212;and on the other hand I have always felt a furious desire to
perturb the heart of each individual man, to exercise an influence upon
each one of my brothers in humanity. Whenever I have spoken in public I
have almost always succeeded in employing a kind of lyrical oratory, and
I have endeavoured to force upon myself the illusion that I was speaking
to only one of my hearers, to any one, no matter which, to each one, not
to all of them <i>en masse</i>.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>We men are impenetrable. Spirits, like solid bodies, can only
communicate with one another by the contact of surfaces, not by
penetrating one another, still less by fusing together.</p>

<p>You have heard me say a thousand times that most spirits seem to me like
crustaceans, with the bone outside and the flesh inside. And when in
some book that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span> I have forgotten I read what a painful and terrible
thing it would be if the human spirit were to be incarnated in a crab
and had to make use of the crab’s senses, organs and members, I said to
myself: “This is what actually happens; we are all unfortunate crabs,
shut up in hard shells.”</p>

<p>And the poet is he whose flesh emerges from the shell, whose soul oozes
forth. And when, in our hours of anguish or joy, our soul oozes forth,
we are all of us poets.</p>

<p>And that is why I believe that it is necessary to agitate the masses, to
shake men and winnow them as in a sieve, to throw against one another,
in order to see if in this way their shells will not break and their
spirits flow forth, whether they will not mingle and unite with one
another, and whether the real collective spirit, the soul of humanity,
may not thus be welded together.</p>

<p>But the sad thing is, if we are to go by past experience, that all these
mutual rubbings and clashings, far from breaking the shells, harden,
thicken and enlarge them. They are like corns that grow larger and
stronger with rubbing. Although perhaps it is that the clashes are not
violent enough. And in any case it must be clashing, not rubbing. I do
not like to rub against people but to clash against them; I do not like
to approach people obliquely and glance off them at a tangent, but to
meet them frontally, and if possible split them in two. It is the best
service I can do them. And there is no better preparation for this task
than solitude.</p>

<p>It is very sad that we have to communicate with one another by touching,
at most by rubbing, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_168">{168}</a></span> medium of the hard shells that isolate
us from one another. And I am convinced that this hard shell becomes
weaker and more delicate, in solitude, until it changes into the most
tenuous membrane which permits of the action of osmosis and exosmosis.
And that is why I believe that it is solitude that makes men really
sociable and human.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>There are two kinds of union: one by removing differences, separating
the elements that differentiate from those that unite, the other by
fusion, bringing these differences into agreement. If we take away from
the mind of each man that which is his own, that way of looking at
things that is peculiar to him, everything that he takes care to hide
for fear people should think him mad, we are left with that which he has
in common with everyone else, and this common element gives us that
wretched thing that is called common sense and which is nothing more
than the abstract of the practical intelligence. But if we fuse into one
the differing judgments of people, with all that they jealously
preserve, and bring their caprices, their oddities, their singularities
into agreement, we shall have human sense, which, in those who are rich
in it, is not common but private sense.</p>

<p>The best that occurs to men is that which occurs to them when they are
alone, that which they dare not confess, not only not to their neighbour
but very often not even to themselves, that which they fly from, that
which they imprison within themselves while it is in a state of pure
thought and before it can flower into words. And the solitary is usually
daring enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_169">{169}</a></span> express this, to allow it to flower, and so it comes
about that he speaks that which others think in solitude by themselves
and which nobody dares to publish. The solitary thinks everything aloud,
and surprises others by saying that which they think beneath their
breath, while they seek to deceive one another by pretending to make
them believe that they are thinking something else, but without anybody
believing them.</p>

<p>All this will help you to deduce for yourself in what way and to what
extent solitude is the great school of sociability, and how right it is
that we should sometimes withdraw ourselves from men in order that we
may the better serve them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p>For some days he had been spiritually restless. His sterile mind flitted
hither and thither like a butterfly. Nothing succeeded in interesting
him. He picked up a book, read two or three pages and then had to close
it again, unable to control his wandering attention. He tried to write,
but half of the sheets that he wrote he tore up. And yet he had never
enjoyed better health, never felt the blood coursing more vigorously
through his veins, or the heart and lungs working in better unison. At
the same time he had a premonition of something strong and mature within
himself striving to come to birth; he felt that he was on the verge of
bringing forth thoughts brimful of vitality and splendour. But
something, a kind of solemn calm, against which he contended in vain,
encompassed and paralysed him. It was no doubt sheer insensibility in
him not to wait in peace for the grace of the Spirit to visit him but to
seek to force it with violence.</p>

<p>At last, one afternoon, when the light of the setting sun was pouring
upon the wide balcony of his cell-like room, he shut himself up in it,
with its dumb books, with all its familiar objects the sight of which
was al<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_171">{171}</a></span>ways grateful to him. It was like shutting himself up within
himself, or even better than that, for this wonted ambience served him
as a means of communion with the world. That square glass inkstand,
those fat pen-holders, that carpet, that stout leather arm-chair in
which his body rested while his mind went galloping away, those rough
plain chairs, those rows of books against the white naked walls: all
these things were a kind of prolongation of his spirit and at the same
time they were like arms which the world stretched out to enfold him in.
They belonged to him and yet they belonged also to the world; they were
himself and at the same they were the not-himself. They would not
deceive him, no. He had touched them once and a thousand times and every
touch had linked itself with all the other touches, until at last these
things of humble use had become invested with a kind of soul made up of
the outpourings of spirit and memories.</p>

<p>He had books that were like lovers, grateful, remembering, for whenever
he opened them at random they opened themselves of their own accord at
the same place, always offering him the same passage, the choicest, the
most intense, the most life-giving that they had to offer. And when he
read the passage over again, the intimate ambience of the peaceful room
yielded up the memory of all the other fugitive moments when he had read
it before, and his soul vibrated across the gulf of time until its
vibrations were lost in that remoteness of the past where consciousness
loses itself too.</p>

<p>From the balcony of his room, across red roofs stained here and there
with the green of lichen, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">{172}</a></span> could just glimpse the clouds glowing in
the sunset light. And nearer at hand, along the eaves of the roof
opposite, the white stone-crop blossomed, its tiny flowerets nourishing
their life upon the moist earthy sediment washed down by the rain from
the sun-baked clay tiles and deposited in the guttering. In summer,
pigeons flew down from the neighbouring belfry to bill and coo upon the
roof, picking the seeds of the stone-crop at its edge, while the dark
swifts skimmed through the air above. Sometimes cats crept stealthily
with sinuous movement across the tiles. Upon this roof too his eyes had
often rested; the little wild garden in the gutter, the pigeons, the
swifts, the cats, these too belonged to him and at the same time to the
world; and often while he had held them in his gaze his mind had been
intent upon his innermost thoughts.</p>

<p>He shut himself up there in his study, like an oyster in its shell. He
untethered his mind, letting it roam at will, without spur or bridle.
For a time it wandered up and down, plucking at passing ideas, ranging
over the backs of the books and divining famous names and titles of
renown. Then it collected itself and withdrew into the body that it
animated and made use of, and presently the arm of this body reached out
for a sheet of paper and the eyes glanced over it.</p>

<p>It was the strident manifesto that had been so much talked about; it was
the famous composition into which he, he himself, who was now sitting at
ease in his cow-hide arm-chair, had emptied his spirit. He began to read
it, and as he read it a strange disquiet invaded him. No, that was not
his, that was not what he had thought and believed, that was not what he
had writ<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_173">{173}</a></span>ten. And yet there could be no doubt about it. That, that which
now seemed so strange to him, he had written that, and it had increased
his fame. He read it over again.</p>

<p>No, we do not communicate what we want to communicate, he reflected. No
sooner does a thought incarnate itself in words and issue forth into the
world than it belongs to someone not ourself, or rather it belongs to
nobody because it belongs to everybody. The flesh with which language
clothes itself is communal and external; it wizens up thought, it
imprisons it and even reverses and falsifies it.</p>

<p>It was a singular and disturbing effect that was produced in him by
reading himself as if he were a stranger, as if his writing had been
written by someone else. This effect of the duplication of his
personality reminded him of a former experience of self-duplication
which he never recalled without a shudder. Once when gazing at the
reflection of his own gaze in a mirror he had the sensation of seeing
himself as someone else; he regarded himself as an unsubstantial shadow,
as an impalpable phantom, and this alarmed him to such a degree that he
called to himself softly by his own name. And his voice sounded to him
as if it were the voice of another, a voice which came forth out of
space, out of the invisible, out of impenetrable mystery. He cleared his
throat, touched himself, felt the quickened beating of his heart. He had
never forgotten that unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>His present feeling was not the same, but it had something that
resembled it. Had he written that? Was he the same person as the man who
had written<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">{174}</a></span> that? Did he contain within himself more than one person?
Might it not be that he carried within him a whole legion of souls
sleeping one below another? Were not all his ancestors sleeping
somewhere in the limbo of his brain? Did others see him as he saw
himself, or did they see him quite differently, and was he always
actually doing and saying that which he thought he was?</p>

<p>This last idea, an absurd and extravagant idea, had obsessed him for
some time past and it caused him anguish, for he said to himself: This
is madness, this is sheer madness.</p>

<p>Only too often, in fact, as he walked quietly along the street, it had
occurred to him to think something like this: “What if, instead of
walking quietly and soberly, I were really pirouetting or making
ridiculous contortions or behaving improperly? This hostility which I
have remarked in certain of my acquaintance, may it not have arisen
because I have said things to them which I am unaware of having said, or
because when I thought I was offering them my hand I was in fact making
some impudent or contemptuous gesture? When I imagine myself to be
saying one thing, may it not be they hear something very different or
perhaps contrary?”</p>

<p>This absurd obsession disquieted him, irritated him, made him doubt the
sanity and vigour of his reason, and he had to exercise all the power of
autosuggestion at his command to overcome it.</p>

<p>With a vigorous effort he threw off this obstinate vagary of his mind,
but only to return to the question of the strangeness of what he had
written.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_175">{175}</a></span></p>

<p>Formerly, a long time ago, he had been a convinced determinist, unable
to tolerate even the mention of free will, so irrational did the
supposition of it seem to him. But later on, after further examination
of the question, his inflexible determinist faith had broken down; and
now, at the time at which we discover him, seated in his arm-chair in
his study, he has put this question of determinism and free will away
into the lumber-room of metaphysics from which he rarely takes it out.
He believes now that science has not succeeded in putting this question
in its true light, but that it always involves it in a <i>petitio
principii</i>. But what he really does feel&#8212;he feels rather than thinks
it&#8212;is that however free a man may be within himself, in so far as he
has to exteriorize and manifest himself, to speak or to act, to
communicate with his fellows, in so far as he has to avail himself of
his body and of the bodies of others, he remains bound by the rigid laws
of these bodies, he is a slave. My acts&#8212;he thinks&#8212;are never
exclusively mine: if I speak I have to make use of air that is not mine
in order to produce my voice; neither are my vocal cords, strictly
speaking, mine; nor is the language mine which I must use if I wish to
make myself understood; and the case is the same if I write, if I strike
a blow, if I kiss, if I fight. And he asks himself in conclusion: “Am I
myself really mine?” And so the tormenting obsession buzzes round him
again.</p>

<p>There is something which we have incorporated and made our own and there
is much that is completely alien to us; and between these two extreme
terms everything is partly ours and partly not ours. Our life is a
continual combat between our spirit which seeks to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_176">{176}</a></span> make itself master
of the world, to make the world its own, to make the world it, and the
world which in its turn seeks to possess itself of our spirit, to make
our spirit its own. I wish to make the world mine&#8212;our man thinks&#8212;to
make it myself, and the world tries to make me its, to make me it; I
strive to personalize it and it strives to depersonalize me. And in this
tragic combat&#8212;for yes, the combat is a tragic one&#8212;I have to make use
of my enemy in order to dominate him, and my enemy has to make use of me
in order to dominate me. Whatever I say, write or do, it is only with
the world’s help that I can say, write or do it; and thus the world at
once depersonalizes my saying, writing and doing and makes them its own,
and I appear to be different from what I am.</p>

<p>What an unhappy necessity is that of writing! What woeful constraint is
that of having to talk! Between any two who talk together, language
mediates, the world mediates, that which is neither one nor the other of
the interlocutors mediates; they are involved in this intrusive element
which, while enabling them to communicate, separates them. If it were
only possible to create language in the very act of speaking our
thought!...</p>

<p>Undoubtedly speech is a more perfect medium than writing, because it is
less material: the vibrations of the air are dissipated, while the trace
of the ink remains. Undoubtedly the <i>flatus vocis</i>, like everything
fugitive, is richer in association, more complete in orchestration,
while writing, like everything concrete, remains detached. But better
still if pure thought could communicate itself by means only of those
vague and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_177">{177}</a></span> fluid words upon which it floats within the soul! To make
oneself understood in words or writing is to communicate the accidents,
not the substance, of thought.</p>

<p>Our man looks at the clouds in the western sky, combed out by the unseen
comb of the wind, and watches them turn to flame in the light of the
setting sun. And he thinks of the substantial communion of spirits,
communication by the act of spiritual presence alone. He remembered how
once, on hearing some old ballad sung by a shepherd boy, the sound of
which had come to him faintly through a leafy screen of grey oaks, he
had trembled and felt as if he heard voices from another world, not from
another world beyond this world, but from a world that lives within the
world we know&#8212;voices which seemed to issue from the very heart of
things, as if they were the song of the soul of the oaks, of the clouds,
of the pebbles of the stream, of the earth and of the sky. Where had he
heard that song before?</p>

<p>Who knows? Perhaps one night, when he lay asleep, the shepherd boy had
passed by singing his song, and the song had lapped his dream and
steeped it in the fountains of life.</p>

<p>Another time&#8212;he remembered&#8212;when on a journey, he had met a woman, a
foreigner, who did not know his language nor did he know hers. Neither
of them knew any human tongue in which they could make themselves
understood, and they sat there in the railway carriage alone, opposite
one another, looking and sometimes smiling at one another. Theirs was a
protracted and mute conversation. When he thought kindly and tenderly of
her the stranger smiled, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">{178}</a></span> when a less innocent desire stirred within
him the shadow of a frown crossed her brow. Perhaps they heard, without
themselves knowing that they heard, the measured beating of their
hearts, beating in unison while their eyes gazed at one another; but
without a doubt the breath of their souls mingled together. For the soul
breathes.</p>

<p>The soul breathes.&#8212;Why not speak in metaphors?</p>

<p>Our man began to think about breathing and how the air, penetrating into
the cells of the lungs, aerates the blood, this inner atmosphere of our
bodies. It is the material substance of the world&#8212;he thought&#8212;which
circulates within us; it is the world diluted and made our own. And from
this he went on to imagine a kind of spiritual aeration of our mind, and
how the world of colours, forms, sounds and impressions of every kind is
diluted in it.</p>

<p>But these are metaphors, nothing but metaphors, he said, then at once
reflecting: Metaphors? and what is not metaphor? Science is built up of
metaphors and language is essentially metaphorical. Matter, force,
light, memory&#8212;all metaphors. When positivists, or those who consider
themselves positivists, try to sweep science clean of metaphors, they
sweep them away with a metaphorical broom, and so sweep the metaphors
back again.</p>

<p>And then his mind began to play around one of his specially favourite
ideas, namely the idea of the superiority of what we call imagination
over the other so-called faculties of the spirit, and how the excellency
of poets was greater than that of men of science and men of action.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_179">{179}</a></span></p>

<p>A thousand times he had deplored the barbarous intransigence of most of
those with whom he had to communicate&#8212;in accidental, not substantial,
communion; that dismal lack of comprehension of every opinion which they
do not themselves share; that ridiculous belief that there are ideas
which one must necessarily consider absurd and which can only be
professed by confused and unhinged minds. All that&#8212;he was wont to say
to himself&#8212;is simply lack of imagination, incapacity to see things
oneself, even momentarily, as others see them, sheer aridity of mind.
How far from all that was the large spirit of the great Goethe, who was
able to feel himself deist, pantheist, atheist all at the same time,
whose mind embraced a profound understanding of paganism together with
an equally profound understanding of Christianity! But Goethe was a
poet, the poet, a true and essential poet, not a miserable didacticist
or dogmatist like those who think they travel more safely the more
ballast of formal logic they carry, at the expense of intelligence, and
the more closely they hug the level shores of thought, moored fast to
tradition and the senses.</p>

<p>Our man cast his eyes once more over the manifesto and said to himself:
“And I have been called an intellectual! I! I who abhor intellectualism
more than anybody! If they had labelled me ‘an imaginative’&#8212;well and
good. But an intellectual?” And he thought of Paul of Tarsus and the
pregnant sentences of his epistles.</p>

<p>He thought of Paul of Tarsus and his classification of men into carnal,
intellectual and spiritual, for so he was pleased to translate it, or
rather to interpret it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_180">{180}</a></span> For there was a time when he had delighted in
exegesis. Not scientific exegesis; not investigating and searching for
the actual meaning of the writers of the sacred books; not co-ordinating
them logically and trying to discover, by reference to the ideas and
sentiment of the age and country in which they lived, what they really
felt and thought; but taking as his starting-point the text that had
been consecrated and enriched by centuries of tradition and thence
launching out into free speculation. The moment that Paul of Tarsus gave
his epistles to the world they ceased to be his, they belonged to the
world, they were part of the common stock, of the patrimony, of
humanity, and it was possible for him to understand them and feel them
altogether differently from the way in which the Apostle himself had
felt and understood them. That which others did to his writings when
they read them and commented upon them, it was possible for him to do to
the Apostle’s, provided he undertook the task with knowledge and
conscientiousness. The actual text furnished his mind with the necessary
foothold, it was the jumping-off place from which his imagination could
take flight.</p>

<p>And in Paul of Tarsus, in his epistle to the Romans and his first
epistle to the Corinthians, he found those three classes of men: the
carnal or <i>sarcinal</i>, σάρϰινοι, the natural or psychical,
Ψυϰικοί, and the spiritual or pneumatical, πνευματικοί.
He had often read that 14th verse of the 7th chapter of
the epistle to the Romans: “For we know that the law is spiritual
[<i>pneumatical</i>]; but I am carnal [<i>sarcinal</i>], sold under sin”; and that
44th verse of the 11th chapter of the first epistle to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_181">{181}</a></span> the Corinthians
which says that there is a natural or <i>psychical</i> body and a spiritual
or <i>pneumatical</i> body; and he was aware that for the Apostle the
<i>psyche</i>, Ψυϰή, was something inferior, something that was
more or less equivalent to what was later to be called the vital force,
the sensitive soul, common to men and animals; the <i>pneuma</i>, on the
other hand, being the higher part of the soul, the spirit, the
ήγεμονικόν of the Stoics, something that survives the body. But he
preferred to give it another interpretation, and he always regarded the
<i>psyche</i> as the intellectual power that is bound to the necessities of
our actual earthly life, the slave of a logic that is educated and
trained by the struggle for life, ordinary, common, current knowledge,
necessary in order to enable us to live, the knowledge from which
science is evolved. He could not help thinking of psychical men as
intellectuals, men of common sense and logic, men whose ideas are
dominated by the associations which the external and visible world
suggests to them, reasonable men who are trained to some profession and
practice it, who, if they are doctors, learn how to cure diseases, if
engineers to construct roads, if chemists to prepare drugs and analyse
compounds, if architects to build houses. These psychical men are the
average men, those who take the middle course, those of whom it is said
that they have a sound and clear judgment and standard, those who do not
believe in any fallacy that is not consecrated by tradition and habit,
those who never swallow any new absurdity, because their minds are
already so stuffed with timeworn absurdities.</p>

<p>Between these and the carnal or <i>sarcinal</i> men he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">{182}</a></span> always established a
difference. For him the carnal men were the brutish, the absolutely
uncultured, those who scarcely think of anything but eating, drinking
and sleeping, those who are wholly and completely immerged in animal
life. The psychical man, no; the psychical man is interested in
questions of science and culture; the psychical Spaniard preaches
national regeneration, is enthusiastic about the telephone, the
gramophone and the cinematograph, reads Flammarion, Haeckel, Ribot, buys
popular works on philosophy, and if he is in the neighbourhood of a
railway stands in ecstatic contemplation of the majestic progress of the
locomotive. If the psychical man is an orthodox Catholic, he admires the
genius of St. Thomas Aquinas, although he has never read him, he knows
that modern geology squares with the Mosaic account of the Creation, and
that it is legitimate to admit a part of Darwinism, and that the Church
possesses a remedy for all the social ills that afflict our age. The
psychical man is an intellectual, his intellect may be small or great,
but fundamentally he is an intellectual.</p>

<p>And lastly come the spiritual men, the dreamers, those whom the
intellectuals contemptuously call mystics, those who tolerate the
tyranny neither of science nor of logic, those who believe that there is
another world within our world and mysterious dormant forces in the
depths of our spirit, those who speak the language of the heart and many
who prefer not to speak at all. Most of the great poets have been
spiritual men, not intellectuals. Of one of them, of the sweet singer
Wordsworth, it has been said that he was a gen<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_183">{183}</a></span>ius without talent, that
is to say a great spirit without sufficient intelligence.</p>

<p>How many times had he not read and re-read the end of the second and the
beginning of the third chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians!
“For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which
is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s
wisdom teacheth [not with didactical arguments, which is the term
employed in the text], but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing
spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man [<i>psychical</i>, or as
our man translated it, intellectual] receiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual
[<i>pneumatical</i>] judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we
have the mind of Christ. And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as
unto spiritual, but as unto carnal [<i>sarcinal</i>], even as unto babes in
Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye
were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet
carnal....”</p>

<p>He turned again to the epistles of Paul of Tarsus and re-read the verses
that he had so often read before. “The things of God knoweth no man, but
the Spirit of God.” And he said to himself: Useless to seek to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">{184}</a></span> know the
things of God by the method of didactical argument, of theology, of
logic; a theology is a contradiction in terms, for the <i>theos</i> is at war
with the <i>logia</i>; arguments do not help us to reach God. And he
remembered Kant and his shattering of the supposed logical proofs of the
existence of God, and how in his own spirit all that scaffolding of a
metalogical belief, spiritual and not intellectual, psychical and not
pneumatical, had collapsed. The ontological proof, the cosmological
proof, the metaphysical proof, the ethical proof, all had come tumbling
down in his mind at the same time, and with them the so-called God of
reason. All that theological rationalism had come to earth in his spirit
with a crash, though the noise of it was heard only by himself,
destroying not a few delicate flowers in its fall and covering the
ground with rubbish. Upheavals of the heart, earthquakes of the spirit,
had cleared the ground of the debris, and in a new way, a way the
intellectuals do not know, there sprung up within him a faith which came
from the Spirit of God. For the things of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God.</p>

<p>“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth, comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.”&#8212;Mystic! This word, spat out with contempt, like an insult
or a reproach, seemed to be spoken into his ear, and so near, so clear,
so distinct it was, that he involuntarily turned his head. And there at
his side, not in the body, visible and tangible, but present in the
spirit, was the prototype of the intellectual, with all his most
exclusively intellectual attributes&#8212;there was the psy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_185">{185}</a></span>chical man, the
natural man <i>par excellence</i>. There he was repeating his physiological
creed parrot-wise, while in his heart he rebelled against his poetic and
creative impotence, against his unconfessed unspirituality.&#8212;He shrugged
his shoulders, smiled and turned again to look at the slowly darkening
sky. The sunset clouds now appeared like mountains of ashes, the remains
of the solar conflagration. He turned on the electric switch and the
wire thread glowed in the bulb&#8212;there was light, light of man’s making,
light of applied science.</p>

<p>“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for
they are foolishness into him: neither can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned.” Foolishness ... madness ... he repeated to
himself, while his eyes wandered over those familiar objects which the
electric light had called forth out of the dark shadows. Madness ... and
what is madness? There are alienists, phreno-pathologists,
psychiatrists, and who knows by how many other names they are called?...
But what is sanity? For perhaps one ought to begin with that.</p>

<p>Health is that condition in which a man is free from every kind of
disease; but what is disease? Health, others say, is “that condition in
which the organism exercises all its faculties normally.”<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Normally
... normally ... and what is the normal? He stretched out his hand for a
book which he was just then reading, a book stored with a mass of data
relating to the mysterious life of the spirit, the work of that noble
mind that had been the soul of the Society for Psychical Research, and
he read:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_186">{186}</a></span></p>

<p>“The word <i>normal</i> in common speech is used almost indifferently to
imply either of two things, which may be very different from each
other&#8212;conformity to a standard and position as an average between
extremes. Often, indeed, the average constitutes the standard&#8212;as when a
gas is of average density; or is practically equivalent to the
standard&#8212;as when a sovereign is of normal weight. But when we come to
living organisms a new factor is introduced. Life is change; each living
organism changes; each generation differs from its predecessor. To
assign a fixed norm to a changing species is to shoot point-blank at a
flying bird. The actual average at any given moment is no ideal
standard; rather, the furthest evolutionary stage now reached is
tending, given stability in the environment, to become the average of
the future.”<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>He shut the book and said to himself again: Normal ... madness ...
sanity ... disease ... health.... The madness of to-day will be the
sanity of to-morrow, just as the sanity of to-day will appear madness
to-morrow. Intellectuals call that madness which they are unable to
understand, for it can only be discerned spiritually. And an
intellectual, what is he, in the last instance, but a normal man, a man
of the <i>via media</i>, equally far removed from the carnal and from the
spiritual man? The intellectual is the man of the <i>via media</i>, at an
equal distance from the enormous mass of carnality and from the very
limited quantity of conscious spirituality&#8212;for the other kind of
spirituality, the unconscious and potential, is dormant in all men<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_187">{187}</a></span> and
is perhaps more alive in the carnal men themselves than in the
intellectuals. For it is easier for the flesh than for the intellect to
receive the spirit; between intellect and spirit the logic of the
schools interposes. The intellectual is the man of average sense, which
he calls common sense, and which is as far from the universal, cosmic or
instinctive sense in which carnal men live, as it is from that private
sense which fortifies the spirit of spiritual men.</p>

<p>“But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
of no man.” By what right do those whose own spirit is buried beneath
their intellect judge the things of the spirit?</p>

<p>“For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But
we have the mind of Christ.” At this word Christ our man’s thinking was
arrested. He had arrived at what is called the religious problem and it
presented itself to him in the form under which he had been
contemplating it now for some time. In this problem&#8212;<i>the</i> problem, the
religious problem&#8212;he saw the principal touchstone that distinguishes
the intellectuals from the spiritual men.</p>

<p>In so far as the religious question is concerned, the intellectuals
presented themselves to him, in effect, as divided into two large
groups, usually called believers and unbelievers. Taking these terms in
the concrete and in relation to his own country, they resolved
themselves into intellectual Catholics and intellectual non-Catholics,
who in practice were always anti-Catholics. These two factions contended
one against another; but as a contest is only possible on a common
basis, they contended on the same ground. No contest is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">{188}</a></span>
between a fish which never emerges from the depths of the sea and a bird
which never descends from the altitudes of the air. These two factions
contended facing one another&#8212;that is to say, one looking in one
direction and the other in another&#8212;but both standing on the same
ground, both on the same plane of intellectuality. And woe to him who
should address them either from above or from below, from another plane
than theirs, from the plane of spirituality or from the plane of
carnality. They will both unite in calling him either a madman or a
brute.</p>

<p>These two factions contend together. For the one, religion is needful as
the necessary basis of morality, social order being impossible without
the fear of hell, of death and of the devil; religion is assured by
external proofs, prophecies, miracles&#8212;or, rather, accounts of
miracles&#8212;and before all and above all, by a tradition of centuries
resting upon an authority. For the other, proofs of the truth of
religion are wanting; social order can be established without hell or
the fear of death and of the devil, and the tradition has neither been
constant nor does it possess any convincing logical value. Both approach
the question from the same side: the one sees in religion a social
institution devoted to the interests of order, the other a social
institution devoted to the interests of despotism; the one seeks for
external logical proofs and the other rejects these proofs. Advocates,
and merely advocates, both of them! For both of them it is a question of
a social institution, something based upon external authorities and
evidences or inevidences, upon something logical or illogical. It is
what they call the conflict between<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_189">{189}</a></span> reason and faith, although this
faith is not faith but only belief. It was not possible for him, for our
man, to feel it in that way, and the arguments of the one side
interested him as little as those of the other. Disputes of
intellectuals!...</p>

<p>He was now called to supper and he went away to attend to the wants of
the body, giving it first food and then sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">{190}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_MATERIALISM_OF_THE_MASSES"></a>THE MATERIALISM OF THE MASSES</h2>

<p>In the course of my frequent peregrinations, when I go up and down the
country preaching my lay sermons in the towns and cities of Spain, I
have a way of taking my audiences as raw material for experiment. I
carry out tests upon them, observing how they respond and react to my
words. And I have observed that whenever they hear me say something
which they think, however erroneously, implies a kind of negation of the
immortality of the soul and of the existence of another life
transcending this world, they break out into applause. And this applause
saddens me and sometimes prompts me to attack.</p>

<p>If these outbursts of applause meant simply: “Hear, hear! Bravo! This
man’s honest. He puts love of truth, however painful the truth may be,
before love of consolation”&#8212;if the applause meant that, I would accept
it, though with a certain sadness. But no, this applause means something
different. It means: “Hear, hear! Excellent! We don’t want another life!
This life is enough for us!” And this wounds me, for it is an explosion
of the most debasing materialism.</p>

<p>Not believing that God exists or that the soul is immortal, or believing
that God does not exist and that the soul is not immortal&#8212;and believing
that the soul<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_191">{191}</a></span> is not immortal is not the same as not believing that it
is immortal&#8212;this is a belief that I can respect; but not wishing that
God should exist or that the soul should be immortal is a thing
profoundly repellent to me.</p>

<p>And it is precisely because I have this thorn in my heart of hearts,
because I cannot resign myself to one day returning to unconsciousness,
because I have a thirst for eternity, that this applause bruises my
heart. That a man should not believe in another life, that I understand,
for I myself find no proof of it; but that he should resign himself to
this, and above all that he should not desire anything more than this
life, that is a thing I do indeed not understand.</p>

<p>And then these gross calumniations of Christ and of Christianity, these
stupidities that go contrary to nature and that have stunted the human
spirit, and all this alluvion of vulgarity that so many unfortunate
people swallow whole....</p>

<p>In one of those series of popular publications which flatter and seduce
the coarsest instincts of the unlettered multitudes, there is a
book&#8212;translated from the Italian, I believe&#8212;entitled “Jesus Christ Has
Never Existed.” It is one of the most deplorable, shallow, and worthless
books imaginable, inspired not by a love of truth but by the most
blatant sectarianism. I was talking about it one day to a man who had
read it and who had been delighted with it, and I said: “It is not the
thesis that shocks me. The thesis that Jesus had no historical
existence, that He is a myth, has many times been put forward, and with
apparently very plausible arguments, at any rate with
erudition&#8212;re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_192">{192}</a></span>cently by Karthoff&#8212;but it is a thesis that has been
demolished by the most judicious investigators, no matter what their
personal creed may have been.” He replied: “Then I’m sorry, for He ought
not to have existed.” And naturally I did not know what to say to that.</p>

<p>This lack of ideality, this aridity and poverty of inward life, which is
implied by not longing for another and transcendental life, all this
practical materialism, is dismaying to the mind of whosoever meditates a
little upon the worth of human life. For my own part, I have very little
hope of peoples who fall into this materialistic attitude.</p>

<p>Understand me clearly: I am not assuring you, nor can I assure you, that
there is another life; I myself am not convinced that there is; but I
cannot conceive that a man, a true man, should not merely resign himself
to the enjoyment of this life only, but that he should renounce and even
spurn another life. And as for this idea that we shall continue to live
in our works, in our children, in the memory of other generations, and
that everything renews and transforms itself, and that we shall help to
build up a more perfect society&#8212;all this appears to me to be the most
miserable subterfuge for escaping the depths of despair.</p>

<p>This is the reason why the radicalism of certain sections of the masses
dismays me and why I cannot hope that anything fruitful will come of it.
The radicalism of the masses in Spain, and perhaps in other so-called
Latin, or, more strictly speaking, Catholic, countries, is lacking in
the spirit and substance of religion. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_193">{193}</a></span> weak point in our socialism
is its confused notion of the supreme end of the individual life.</p>

<p>Let us better the economic condition of man&#8212;good! Let us put an end to
the division between rich and poor&#8212;exactly! Let us realize a state in
which a moderate amount of work will be sufficient to satisfy all our
wants&#8212;very good! And then? We have now created a society such as Bebel
or Kropotkin dreamed of, and what is to happen to each one of us in this
society? What is to be the end of this society? What shall we live for?</p>

<p>“Get rich!” said Guizon, the Calvinist, to the Catholic bourgeoisie of
France; “get rich!” Very good. And then, when we have got rich?...</p>

<p>A country in which the people think only of getting rich is a country
... well, I would rather not inquire what kind of a country it is.
Suffice it to say that I at any rate should die in it of cold, of shame,
of disgust.</p>

<p>And if a country which is solely preoccupied with getting rich is
abhorrent to me, still more abhorrent is the country in which the
dominant preoccupation is that of enjoyment, of diversion. In other
words, of self-stupefaction.</p>

<p>A collective patriotic enthusiasm, an imperialistic instinct, a
passionate desire to influence other peoples and to impress your own
stamp upon them&#8212;this, after all, is something. But this enthusiasm,
this instinct, this desire, lives and burns in those peoples which
preserve the inward spring of religion, an underlying inextinguishable
thirst for eternity.</p>

<p>The people that is satisfied with this life lives,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">{194}</a></span> strictly speaking,
on the defensive, and the people that lives on the defensive ends by
being absorbed and dominated by those in whom the aggressive and
dominating instinct is uppermost. The so-called struggle for life is
efficacious only when the struggle is for predominance, not for
preservation. The essence of being, as Spinoza showed, consists not so
much in the effort to persist in mere being as in the effort to become
more, to become everything. It is the appetite for infinity and
eternity.</p>

<p>I do not know what is to be hoped from peoples that have been
materialized by a long indoctrination of implicit Catholic faith, whose
beliefs are a matter of routine, in whom the inner spring appears to be
exhausted&#8212;that inward disquietude which distinguishes the essentially
Protestant spirit. I do not know what is to be hoped from peoples in
whom centuries of a religion more social than individual, characterized
rather by ritual and ceremony and externality and authority than by
inward struggle, have resulted in generating a kind of free-thinking
that issues in indifference and in resignation to the life of this
world.</p>

<p>From the superstition of a ridiculous and childish heaven and hell they
have fallen into the superstition of a gross and unspiritual earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_195">{195}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_MAN_OF_FLESH_AND_BONE"></a>THE MAN OF FLESH AND BONE</h2>

<p><i>Homo sum; nihil humani a me alienum puto</i>, said the Latin playwright.
And I would rather say: <i>Nullum hominem a me alienum puto</i>: I am a man;
no other man do I deem a stranger. For to me the adjective <i>humanus</i> is
no less suspect than its abstract substantive <i>humanitas</i>, humanity.
Neither the “human” nor “humanity,” neither the simple adjective nor the
substantivized adjective, but the concrete substantive&#8212;man. The man of
flesh and bone; the man who is born, suffers, and dies&#8212;above all, who
dies; the man who eats and drinks and plays and thinks and wills; the
man who is seen and heard; the brother, the real brother.</p>

<p>For there is something else that is also called man, and he is the
subject of many more or less scientific speculations. He is the
legendary featherless biped, the ξῷον πολιτικόυ of Aristotle,
the social contractor of Rousseau, the <i>homo economicus</i> of the
Manchester school, the <i>homo sapiens</i> of Linnæus, or, if you like, the
vertical mammal. A man neither of here nor there, neither of this age
nor of another, who has neither sex nor country, who is, in brief,
merely an idea. That is to say, a no-man.</p>

<p>Our man is the other man, the man of flesh and bone&#8212;I and you, my
reader, and the other man over there, all of us who weigh upon the
earth.</p>

<p>And this concrete man, this man of flesh and bone, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">{196}</a></span> at once the
subject and the supreme object of all philosophy, whether certain
self-styled philosophers like it or not.</p>

<p>In most of the histories of philosophy that I know, philosophic systems
are presented to us as if they grew out of one another and their
authors, the philosophers, appear only as mere pretexts. The inward
biography of the philosophers, of the men who philosophized, occupies a
secondary place. And it is this, nevertheless, this inward biography,
that explains most things to us.</p>

<p>It behoves us to say, before all, that philosophy lies closer to poetry
than to science. All philosophic systems that have been constructed as a
supreme concord of the final results of the individual sciences have in
every age possessed much less consistency and less life than those which
have expressed the integral desire of the spirit of their authors.</p>

<p>For the fact is that the sciences, important to us as they are and
indeed indispensable for our life and thought, are in a certain sense
more extraneous to us than philosophy. They fulfil a more objective end,
that is to say, an end more external to ourselves. They are, at bottom,
a matter of economics. A new scientific discovery, of the kind called
theoretical, is like a mechanical discovery&#8212;that of the steam-engine,
the telephone, the phonograph, or the aeroplane&#8212;a thing that is useful
for something. Thus the telephone may be useful to us in enabling us to
communicate at a distance with the woman we love. But she, what is she
useful to us for? A man takes an electric tram to go to hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_197">{197}</a></span> an opera
and asks himself: Which is in this case more useful, the tram or the
opera?</p>

<p>Philosophy answers to our need of forming a complete and unitary
conception of the world and of life, and as a result of this conception,
a feeling which gives birth to an inward attitude and even to an
activity. But in fact this feeling, instead of being a consequence of
this conception, is the cause of it. Our philosophy&#8212;that is, our mode
of understanding or of not understanding the world and life&#8212;springs
from our feeling towards life itself. And this, like everything
affective, has subconscious, perhaps unconscious, roots.</p>

<p>It is not usually our ideas that make us optimists or pessimists, but it
is our optimism or our pessimism, of physiological or perhaps
pathological origin, as much the one as the other, that makes our ideas.</p>

<p>Man, they say, is a reasoning animal. I do not know why he has not been
defined as an affective or feeling animal. Perhaps that which
differentiates him from other animals is feeling rather than reason.
More often I have seen a cat reason than laugh or weep. Perhaps it weeps
or laughs inwardly&#8212;but then perhaps the crab also resolves equations of
the second degree inwardly.</p>

<p>And thus in a philosopher what must most concern us is the man.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Man is an end, not a means. All civilization addresses itself to man, to
each man, to each “I.” What is this idol&#8212;call it Humanity or call it
what you will&#8212;to which all men and each individual man must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">{198}</a></span>
sacrificed? For I sacrifice myself for my neighbours, for my
fellow-countrymen, for my children, and these sacrifice themselves in
their turn for theirs, and theirs again for those who come after them,
and so on in a never-ending series of generations. And who receives the
fruit of this sacrifice?</p>

<p>Those who talk to us about this fantastic sacrifice, this dedication
without an object, are wont to talk to us also about the right to live.
And what is this right to live? They tell me that I have come into the
world to realize I know not what social end; but I feel that I, like
each one of my fellows, am here to realize myself, to live.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I see it all&#8212;an enormous social activity, a mighty
civilization, an accumulation of science, of art, of industry, of
morality, and afterwards, when we have filled the world with industrial
marvels, with great factories, with roads, with museums, with libraries,
we shall fall exhausted at the foot of it all, and it will endure&#8212;for
whom? Was man made for science or was science made for man?</p>

<p>“Why!”&#8212;the reader will exclaim&#8212;“we are getting back to what the
Catechism says: ‘Q. For whom did God create the world? A. For man’?”
Precisely&#8212;so ought the man who is a man to reply. The ant, if it took
account of these matters and were a person, conscious of itself, would
reply: “For the ant,” and it would reply rightly. The world is made for
consciousness, for each consciousness.</p>

<p>A human soul is worth all the universe, someone has said&#8212;I know not
who, but it was excellently well said. A human soul, mind you! Not a
human life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_199">{199}</a></span> Not this life. And it is a fact that the less a man
believes in the soul, that is to say, in his conscious immortality,
personal and concrete, the more he will exaggerate the worth of this
poor transitory life. Hence arises the effeminate sentimental feeling
against war. True, a man ought not to wish to die, but it is the other,
the eternal death, that he ought not to wish. “Whosoever will save his
life shall lose it,” says the Gospel; but it does not say “whosoever
will save his soul,” the immortal soul&#8212;the soul that we believe and
wish to be immortal.</p>

<p>And all those definers of objectism do not realize, or rather do not
wish to realize, that a man, in affirming his “I,” his personal
consciousness, affirms man, man concrete and real, affirms the true
humanism&#8212;the humanism of man, not of the things of man&#8212;and in
affirming man he affirms consciousness. For the only consciousness of
which we have consciousness is that of man.</p>

<p>The world is for consciousness. Or rather this <i>for</i>, this notion of
finality, and feeling rather than notion, this teleological feeling is
born only where there is consciousness. Consciousness and finality are
the same thing fundamentally.</p>

<p>If the sun possessed consciousness it would think, no doubt, that it
lived in order to give light to the worlds; but it would also and above
all think that the worlds existed in order that it might give them light
and joy in giving them light and so live. And it would think well.</p>

<p>And all this tragic fight of man to save himself, this immortal craving
for immortality which caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_200">{200}</a></span> the man Kant to make that immortal leap<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
of which I have spoken, all this is simply a fight for consciousness. If
consciousness is, as some inhuman thinker has said, nothing more than a
flash of light between two eternities of darkness, then there is nothing
more execrable than existence.</p>

<p>It is possible that someone will discover that everything that I am
saying rests upon a contradiction, since sometimes I express a longing
for immortality and at other times I say that this life does not possess
the value that is attributed to it. Contradiction? To be sure! The
contradiction of my heart that says Yes and of my head that says No. Of
course there is contradiction. Who does not recollect those words of the
Gospel: “Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief”? Contradiction? Of
course! For we only live upon contradictions and by them; life is
tragedy, and the tragedy is perpetual struggle, without victory or the
hope of victory; life is contradiction.</p>

<p>It is a question, as you see, of an affective value, and against
affective values reasons do not avail. For reasons are nothing more than
reasons, that is to say, they are not even truths. There are
definition-mongers&#8212;pedants by nature and by grace&#8212;who produce an
effect upon me like that of a man who consoles a father for the loss of
a son, dead in the prime of his life, by saying: “Patience, friend, we
all must die.” Would you think it strange if this father were irritated
by such<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_201">{201}</a></span> an ineptitude? For it is an ineptitude. How often may it not be
said&#8212;</p>

<p>There are, in fact, people who appear to think only with the brain or
with whatever other organ may be the specific organ for thinking; while
others think with the whole body and with the whole soul, with the
blood, with the marrow of the bones, with the heart, with the lungs,
with the belly, with the life. And the people who think only with the
brain become definition-mongers; they become the professionals of
thought. And you know what a professional is....</p>

<p>If a philosopher is not a man, he is anything rather than a philosopher;
he is, above all, a pedant, that is to say, a caricature of a man. The
cultivation of any science&#8212;of chemistry, of physics, of geometry, of
philology&#8212;may be, though within very narrow limits and restrictions, a
work of differentiated specialization; but philosophy, like poetry, is
either a work of integration and harmony or else it is mere
philosophism, psuedo-philosophical erudition.</p>

<p>All knowledge has an ultimate object. Knowing for the sake of knowing
is, say what you will, nothing but a solemn begging of the question. We
learn a thing either for an immediate practical end, or in order to
complete the rest of our knowledge. Even the ideas that appear to us
most theoretical&#8212;that is to say, of least immediate application to the
non-intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_202">{202}</a></span> necessities of life&#8212;answer to an intellectual
necessity, which is also a real necessity, to a principle of unity and
continuity of consciousness. But just as scientific knowledge has its
finality in the rest of our knowledge, the philosophy which we may be
forced to choose has another extrinsic finality&#8212;it refers to our whole
destiny, to our attitude towards life and the universe. And the most
tragic problem of philosophy is that of reconciling intellectual
necessities of the heart and the will. For it is just here that every
philosophy that claims to resolve the eternal and tragic contradiction
that is the very basis of our existence breaks down. But do all men
confront this contradiction?</p>

<p>Little can be hoped for from a ruler, for example, who has not been
preoccupied at some time or other, even if only in some dim way, with
the first beginning and ultimate end of all things, and, above all, of
men, with their first “why” and their ultimate “wherefore.”</p>

<p>And this supreme preoccupation cannot be purely rational, it must be
affective. It is not enough to think about our destiny, it must be felt.
And the would-be leader of men who says and proclaims that he pays no
heed to the things of the spirit, does not deserve to lead them. Which
does not mean, of course, that any determinate solution is to be
required of him. Solution? Is there, indeed, any?</p>

<p>For my part, I will never willingly yield myself, nor entrust my
confidence, to any popular leader who has not a real conviction that the
leader of a people is a leader of men&#8212;men of flesh and bone; men who
are born, suffer, and, although they may not wish to die, die; men who
are ends in themselves, not merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_203">{203}</a></span> means; men who have to be themselves
and not others; men, in short, who seek that which we call happiness. It
is inhuman, for example, to sacrifice one generation of men to the
generation following when there is no regard for the destiny of those
sacrificed&#8212;not merely for their memory, for their names, but for
themselves.</p>

<p>All this idea that a man lives in his children, or in his works, or in
the universe, is but vague verbiage which satisfies only those who
suffer from affective stupidity and who may, for the rest, be persons of
a certain cerebral distinction. For it is possible to possess a great
talent or what we call great talent, and yet to be stupid as far as the
feelings are concerned, and even morally imbecile. There have been
instances.</p>

<p>Those who are mentally talented and affectively stupid usually say that
it is useless to seek to delve into the unknowable or to kick against
the pricks. It is as if one should say to a man whose leg has been
amputated that it is useless to think about it. And we all lack
something; only some of us feel it and others do not. Or they pretend
not to feel it, and then they are hypocrites.</p>

<p>There is something which, for want of a better name, we will call the
tragic sense of life, which carries with it a whole conception of life
itself and of the universe, a whole philosophy, more or less formulated,
more or less conscious. And this sense may be possessed, and is
possessed, not only by individual men but by whole peoples. And this
sense does not flow from ideas but rather determines them, although
afterwards, of course, these ideas react upon the sense and confirm it.
Sometimes this sense may proceed from a casual illness<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">{204}</a></span>&#8212;from dyspepsia,
for example&#8212;but at other times it is constitutional. And it is useless
to speak of men who are healthy and men who are unhealthy. Apart from
there being no normal standard of health, nobody has proved that man is
necessarily cheerful by nature. And, further, man, by the very fact of
being man, of possessing consciousness, is, when compared with the ass
or the crab, already a diseased animal. Consciousness is a disease.</p>

<p>Among men of flesh and bone there have been typical examples of those
who possess the tragic sense of life. I recall now Marcus Aurelius, St.
Augustine, Pascal, Rousseau, <i>René</i>, <i>Obermann</i>, Thomson,<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Leopardi,
Vigny, Lenau, Kleist, Amiel, Quental, Kierkegaard&#8212;men laden with wisdom
rather than with knowledge.</p>

<p>And there are, I believe, also peoples who possess this tragic sense of
life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_205">{205}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_PROBLEM_OF_IMMORTALITY"></a>THE PROBLEM OF IMMORTALITY</h2>

<p>The great master of rationalist phenomenalism, David Hume, begins his
essay “On the Immortality of the Soul” with these decisive words: “It
appears difficult by the mere light of reason to prove the immortality
of the soul. The arguments in favour of it are commonly derived from
metaphysical, moral, or physical considerations. But it is really the
Gospel, and only the Gospel, that has brought to light life and
immortality.” Which is equivalent to denying the rationality of the
belief that the soul of each one of us is immortal.</p>

<p>Kant, who took Hume as the starting-point for his criticism, attempted
to establish the rationality of this longing for immortality and the
belief that it imports, and that is the real origin, the inward origin,
of his “Critique of Practical Reason” and of his categorical imperative
and of his God. But in spite of all this, the sceptical affirmation of
Hume remains unshaken. There is no way of rationally proving the
immortality of the soul. There are, on the other hand, ways of
rationally proving its mortality.</p>

<p>It would be not merely superfluous but ridiculous to explain here at
length how far the individual human consciousness depends upon the
organization of the body, how it comes gradually to birth according as
the brain receives impressions from without, how it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_206">{206}</a></span> temporally
interrupted during sleep, swoons, and other accidents, and how
everything leads us to the rational conjecture that death carries with
it loss of consciousness. And just as before our birth we were not, nor
have we any personal pre-natal memory, so after our death we shall no
longer be. This is the rational position.</p>

<p>Rationalism&#8212;and by rationalism I mean the doctrine that abides solely
by reason, by objective truth&#8212;is necessarily materialist. And let not
idealists be scandalized thereby.</p>

<p>The truth is&#8212;it is necessary to state it clearly&#8212;that what we call
materialism means for us nothing else but the doctrine which denies the
immortality of the individual soul, the persistence of personal
consciousness after death.</p>

<p>In another sense it may be said that, since we know what spirit is, and
since matter is for us no more than an idea, materialism is idealism. In
fact, and as regards our problem&#8212;the most vital, the only really vital
problem&#8212;it is all the same to say that everything is matter as to say
that everything is idea, or everything energy, or what you please. Every
monist system will always seem to us materialist. The immortality of the
soul is saved only by the dualist systems&#8212;those which teach that human
consciousness is something substantially distinct and different from
other manifestations of phenomena. And reason is naturally monist. For
it is the function of reason to understand and explain the universe, and
in order to understand and explain it, it is in no way necessary for the
soul to be an imperishable substance. For the purpose of un<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_207">{207}</a></span>derstanding
and explaining our psychic life, for psychology, the hypothesis of the
soul is unnecessary.</p>

<p>All the attempts to substantivate consciousness, making it independent
of extension&#8212;it will be remembered that Descartes opposed thought to
extension&#8212;are but sophistical subtleties intended to establish the
rationality of faith in the immortality of the soul. It is sought to
give the value of objective reality to that which does not possess it,
to that of which the reality exists only in thought. And the immortality
that we crave is a phenomenal reality, it is a continuation of this
life.</p>

<p>From whatever side we look at it, it is always found that reason
confronts our longing for personal immortality and contradicts it. And
in strict truth, reason is the enemy of life. All that is vital is
anti-rational, and all that is rational is anti-vital, for reason is
essentially sceptical.</p>

<p>Rationalists persist in endeavouring to convince men that there are
motives for living and that there is a consolation for having been born,
even though there must come a time, at the end of some tens or hundreds
or millions of centuries, when all human consciousness shall have ceased
to exist. And these motives for living and working, this thing which
some call humanism, illustrate the amazing affectional and emotional
hollowness of rationalism and of its stupendous hypocrisy&#8212;a hypocrisy
that is resolved to sacrifice sincerity to veracity and not to confess
that reason is a dissolvent and disconsolatory power.</p>

<p>Must I repeat again what I have already said about all this idea of
creating culture, of progressing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">{208}</a></span> of realizing good, truth, and beauty,
of establishing justice on earth, of ameliorating life for those who
shall come after us, of subserving I know not what destiny, divorced
from all preoccupation with the ultimate end of each one of us? Must I
again declare to you the supreme vacuity of culture, of art, of good, of
truth, of beauty, of justice ... of all these beautiful conceptions, if
at the last end of everything, in four days or in four million
centuries&#8212;it matters not which&#8212;no human consciousness shall exist to
appropriate this culture, this science, art, good, truth, beauty,
justice, and all the rest?</p>

<p>Many and various have been the rationalist devices&#8212;more or less
rational&#8212;from the days of the Epicureans and the Stoics, by means of
which it has been sought to discover rational consolation in truth and
to convince men&#8212;though the convincers were themselves unconvinced&#8212;that
there are motives for working and lures for living, even though the
human consciousness be destined ultimately to disappear.</p>

<p>The Epicurean attitude, the extreme and grossest expression of which is
“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,” or the Horatian <i>carpe
diem</i>, which may be rendered by “Live for the day,” is not radically
different from the Stoic attitude with its “Do what your conscience
tells you, and afterward let it be as it may be.” Both attitudes have a
common base, and pleasure for pleasure’s sake comes to the same thing as
duty for duty’s sake.</p>

<p>It is true that there are people who assert that reason suffices them,
and they counsel us not to seek to penetrate into the impenetrable. But
of those who say<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_209">{209}</a></span> that they have no need of any faith in eternal
personal life in order to find incentives to living and motives for
action, I know not well how to think. A man blind from birth may also
assure us that he feels no great desire to enjoy the world of sight nor
suffers any great anguish from not having enjoyed it, and we must needs
believe him, for <i>nihil volitum quin præcognitum</i>, nothing can be willed
that is not previously known. But I cannot be persuaded that he who has
once in his life, either in his youth or at some other point of time,
cherished the belief in the immortality of the soul, will ever find
peace without it. And this kind of blindness from birth is scarcely
possible among men, except by a strange aberration. And the merely and
exclusively rational man is an aberration and nothing but an aberration.</p>

<p>I do not know why so many people were scandalized, or pretended to be
scandalized, when Brunetière proclaimed once again the bankruptcy of
science. For science, in so far as it is a substitute for religion, and
reason, in so far as it is a substitute for faith, have always
foundered. Science will be able to satisfy in an increasing measure, and
in fact does satisfy, our increasing logical and intellectual needs, our
desire to know and understand the truth; but science does not satisfy
the needs of our heart and our will, our hunger for immortality&#8212;far
from satisfying it, it contradicts it. Rational life and truth stand in
opposition to one another. And can it be that there is any other truth
than rational truth?</p>

<p>It must remain established, therefore, that reason, human reason, within
its limits not only does not prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_210">{210}</a></span> rationally that the soul is immortal
and that the human consciousness is through all the ages indestructible,
but that it proves rather&#8212;within its limits, I repeat&#8212;that the
individual consciousness cannot persist after the death of the physical
organism upon which it depends. And these limits, within which I say
that human reason proves this, are the limits of rationality, of what we
know by demonstration. Beyond these limits is the irrational, which is
all the same whether it be called the super-rational or the
infra-rational or the contra-rational. Beyond these limits is the absurd
of Tertullian, the impossible of the <i>certum est, quia impossible est</i>.
And this absurd can only base itself upon the most absolute incertitude.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The vital longing for human immortality, therefore, finds no rational
confirmation, nor does reason give us any incentive or consolation for
living or give to life itself any real finality. But here, in the depths
of the abyss, the despair of the heart and the will and the scepticism
of reason meet face to face and embrace fraternally. And it will be from
this embrace, a tragic, that is to say a profoundly loving, embrace,
that the fountain of life will flow, a life earnest and terrible.
Scepticism, uncertainty&#8212;the ultimate position at which reason arrives
by practising its analysis upon itself, upon its own validity&#8212;is the
foundation upon which the despair of the vital sense must build its
hope.</p>

<p>Disillusioned, we have had to abandon the position of those who seek to
convert rational and logical truth into consolation, pretending to prove
the rationality, or at any rate the non-irrationality, of consolation;
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_211">{211}</a></span> we have had to abandon likewise the position of those who seek to
convert consolation and motives for living into rational truth. Neither
of these positions satisfies us. The one is at variance with our reason,
the other with our feeling. Peace between these two powers is impossible
and we must live by their war. We must make of this war, of war itself,
the condition of our spiritual life.</p>

<p>Faith in immortality is irrational. And nevertheless, faith, life and
reason have mutual need of one another. This vital longing is not
properly a problem, cannot be formulated in propositions capable of
rational discussion; but it announces itself in us as hunger announces
itself. Neither can the wolf that throws itself upon its prey to devour
it or upon the she-wolf to fecundate her, enunciate its impulse
rationally and as a logical problem. Reason and faith are two enemies
neither of which can maintain itself without the other. The irrational
demands to be rationalized and reason alone can operate on the
irrational. They are compelled to seek mutual support and association.
But association in conflict, for conflict is a mode of association.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>There is no possible permanent position of agreement and harmony between
reason and life, between philosophy and religion. And the tragic history
of human thought is simply the history of a struggle between reason and
life&#8212;reason bent on rationalizing life and making it resign itself to
the inevitable, to mortality; life bent on vitalizing reason and forcing
it to serve as a support for its vital desires. And this is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_212">{212}</a></span> history
of philosophy, inseparable from the history of religion.</p>

<p>Our sense of the world, of objective reality, is necessarily subjective,
human, anthropomorphic. And vitalism will always rise up against
rationalism, the will will always stand up against reason. Hence the
rhythm of the history of philosophy and the alternation of periods in
which life imposes itself, giving birth to spiritual forms, with periods
in which reason imposes itself, giving birth to materialistic forms,
although both of these classes of forms of belief may disguise
themselves under other names. Neither reason nor life ever acknowledges
itself vanquished.</p>

<p>No doubt it will be said that life ought to submit to reason and to this
we shall reply that nothing ought to be done that cannot be done, and
life cannot submit to reason. “Ought, therefore can,” some Kantian will
retort. To which we shall demur: “Cannot, therefore ought not.” And life
cannot submit to reason, because the end of life is living and not
understanding.</p>

<p>There is always someone who will tell us of the religious duty of
resigning ourselves to mortality. This is indeed the very summit of
aberration and insincerity. And over against sincerity will be set the
opposing ideal of veracity. Be it so, and yet it is quite possible to
reconcile the two. Veracity, respect for what I believe to be rational,
for what we call truth in the logical sense, moves me to affirm that the
immortality of the individual soul is a logical contradiction, is
something not only irrational but contra-rational; but sincerity leads
me to affirm also that I do not resign myself to this former affirmation
and that I protest against its<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_213">{213}</a></span> validity. What I feel is a truth, as
much a truth at any rate as what I see, touch, hear, and what is
demonstrated to me&#8212;I believe that it is even more of a truth&#8212;and
sincerity obliges me not to hide my feelings.</p>

<p>And in self-defence life searches for the weak point in reason and finds
it in scepticism, which it seizes hold of, endeavouring to save itself
by maintaining its hold. It needs the weakness of its adversary.</p>

<p>In an outburst of passion, Lamennais exclaims: “But what! All hope lost,
shall we plunge blindly into the mute depths of a universal scepticism?
Shall we doubt that we think, that we feel, that we are? Nature does not
allow it; she forces us to believe even when our reason is not
convinced. Absolute certainty and absolute doubt are both alike
forbidden to us. We hover in a vague mean between these two extremes, as
between being and nothingness; for complete scepticism would be the
extinction of the intelligence and the total death of man. But it is not
given to man to annihilate himself; there is in him something which
invincibly resists destruction, I know not what vital faith, which the
will itself cannot master. Whether he like it or not, he must believe,
because he must act, because he must preserve himself. His reason, if he
listened only to that, teaching him to doubt everything, itself
included, would reduce him to a state of absolute inaction; he would
perish before even he had been able to prove to himself that he
existed.”<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It is not strictly true that reason leads us to absolute scepticism. No,
reason does not lead me and cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_214">{214}</a></span> lead me to doubt that I exist.
Whither reason does lead me is to vital scepticism, or more properly to
vital negation&#8212;not merely to doubt but to deny that my consciousness
survives my death. Vital scepticism comes from the clash between reason
and desire. And from this clash, from this embrace between despair and
scepticism is born holy, sweet, saving incertitude, our supreme
consolation.</p>

<p>The absolute and complete certainty, on the one hand, that death is a
complete, definite, irrevocable annihilation of personal consciousness,
a certainty of the same order as the certainty that the three angles of
a triangle are equal to two right angles, or, on the other hand, the
absolute and complete certainty that our personal consciousness is
prolonged beyond death in these or those conditions, including withal
the extraneous and adventitious addition of eternal rewards and
punishments&#8212;both of these certainties would equally make life
impossible for us. In the most secret chamber of the spirit of him who
believes himself convinced that death puts an end to his personal
consciousness, his memory, for ever, there lurks a shadow, all unknown
to him perhaps, a vague shadow, a shadow of a shadow of uncertainty, and
while he says within himself: “Well, let us live this passing life, for
there is no other!” the silence of this secret chamber speaks to him and
murmers: “Who knows!...” He may not think he hears it, but he hears it.
And likewise in some secret place of the soul of the believer who most
firmly holds the faith in future life, there is a muffled voice, a voice
of uncertainty, which whispers in the ear of his spirit: “Who knows!...”
These voices are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_215">{215}</a></span> like the humming of a mosquito when the gale roars
through the trees in the wood; we cannot distinguish this faint humming,
nevertheless, merged in the clamour of the storm, it reaches the ear.
Otherwise, without this uncertainty, how could we live?</p>

<p>“Is there?” “Is there not?”&#8212;these are the bases of our inner life.
There may be a rationalist who has never wavered in his conviction of
the mortality of the soul, and there may be a vitalist who has never
wavered in his faith in immortality; but at the most this would only
prove that just as there are monsters, so there are people who are
affectively and feelingly stupid, however much intelligence they may
have, and people who are intellectually stupid, however great their
virtue may be. But in normal cases I cannot believe those who assure me
that never, not even for a moment, not in the hours of greatest
loneliness and tribulation, has this murmur of uncertainty breathed upon
their consciousness. I do not understand the men who tell me that the
prospect of the yonder side of death has never tormented them, that the
thought of their own annihilation never disquiets them. For my part I do
not wish to make peace between my heart and my head, between my faith
and my reason&#8212;I wish rather that there should be war between them.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>“Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief!” This may appear to be a
contradiction, for if the man believes, if he trusts, how is it that he
beseeches the Lord to help his lack of trust? Nevertheless it is this
contradiction that gives all its deepest human value to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_216">{216}</a></span> cry torn
from the heart of the father of a demoniac. His faith is a faith that is
based upon incertitude. Because he believes, that is to say, because he
wishes to believe, because he has need that his son should be cured&#8212;he
beseeches the Lord to help his unbelief, his doubt that such a cure
could be effected. Of such a kind is human faith. Of such a kind was the
heroic faith that Sancho Panza had in his master, the knight Don Quixote
de la Mancha, as I think I have shown in my “Life of Don Quixote and
Sancho”&#8212;a faith based upon incertitude, upon doubt. Sancho Panza was
indeed a man, a whole and a real man, and he was not stupid, for only if
he had been stupid would he have believed without a shadow of doubt in
the follies of his master. Neither did his master believe in them
without a shadow of doubt, for neither was Don Quixote, though mad,
stupid. He was fundamentally a man of despair, as I think I have shown
in my book. And because he was a man of an heroic despair, the hero of
that inward and resigned despair, he is the eternal exemplar of every
man whose soul is the battle-ground of reason and immortal desire. Our
Lord Don Quixote is the prototype of the vitalist whose faith is based
upon incertitude, and Sancho is the prototype of the rationalist who
doubts his own reason.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_217">{217}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CREATIVE_FAITH"></a>CREATIVE FAITH</h2>

<p>When as a boy I began to be disquieted by the eternal problems, I read
in a book, the author of which I have no wish to recall, this sentence:
“God is the great x placed over the barrier of human knowledge&#8212;as
science advances, the barrier recedes.” And I wrote in the margin: “On
this side of the barrier, everything is explained without Him; on the
further side, nothing is explained, either with Him or without Him. God,
therefore, is superfluous.” And so as far as concerns the God-Idea, the
God whose existence is supposed to be logically proved, I continue to be
of the same opinion. Laplace is said to have stated that he had not
found the hypothesis of God necessary in the construction of his system
of the origin of the Universe, and it very certainly is so. The idea of
God does not in any way help us to understand any better the existence,
the essence and the finality of the Universe.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The living God, the human God, is reached not by the way of reason but
by the way of love and of suffering. Reason rather separates us from
Him. It is not possible to know Him in order that afterwards we may love
Him; we must begin by loving Him, longing for Him, hungering for Him,
before knowing Him. The knowledge of God proceeds from the love of God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_218">{218}</a></span>
and it is a knowledge that has little or nothing of the rational in it.
For God is indefinable. To seek to define Him is to claim to limit Him
in our mind&#8212;that is to say, to kill Him. In so far as we attempt to
define Him, we are confronted by Nothingness.</p>

<p>The idea of God which the would-be rational theodicy presents us with is
merely an hypothesis, like the hypothesis of the ether, for example.</p>

<p>The ether is, in effect, merely a hypothetical entity, which is of value
only in so far as it explains that which by means of it we seek to
explain&#8212;light, or electricity, or universal gravitation&#8212;and only so
far as these facts cannot be explained in any other way. Similarly the
idea of God is also an hypothesis which is of value only in so far as we
explain by means of it that which we seek to explain&#8212;the essence and
existence of the Universe&#8212;and only so long as these cannot be explained
better in some other way. And since in reality we explain the Universe
neither better nor worse with this idea than without it, the idea of
God, the supreme <i>petitio principii</i>, fails of its purpose.</p>

<p>But if the ether is nothing but an hypothesis intended to explain light,
air on the other hand is a thing that is directly felt; and even though
it did not enable us to explain sound, we should have a direct sensation
of it, and, above all, of the lack of it in moments of suffocation or
air-hunger. And in the same way, God Himself, not the idea of God, may
become a directly felt reality; and although the idea of Him may not
enable us to explain either the existence or the essence of the
Universe, we have at times the direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_219">{219}</a></span> feeling of God, above all in
moments of spiritual suffocation. And this feeling&#8212;mark it well, for
herein lies its tragicness and the whole tragic sense of life&#8212;is a
feeling of hunger for God, of lack of God. To believe in God is, in the
first instance, to wish that there may be a God, not to be able to live
without Him.</p>

<p>So long as I pilgrimaged through the fields of reason in search of God,
I could not find Him, for I was not taken in by the idea of God, neither
could I take an idea for God; and it was then, as I wandered among the
wastes of rationalism, that I told myself that we ought to seek no other
consolation than the truth, meaning thereby reason, and yet for all that
I was not comforted. But as I sank deeper and deeper into rational
scepticism on the one hand and into heart’s despair on the other, the
hunger for God awoke within me, and the suffocation of spirit made me
feel the want of God, and with the want of Him, His reality. And I
wished that there might be a God, that God might exist.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>The problem of the existence of God, a problem that is rationally
insoluble, is in its essence none other than the problem of
consciousness, the very problem of the substantial existence of the
soul, the very problem of the perpetuity of the human soul, the very
problem of the human finality of the Universe. To believe in a living
and personal God, in an eternal and universal consciousness that knows
us and loves us, is to believe that the Universe exists <i>for</i> man. For
man, or for a consciousness of the same order as the human
con<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">{220}</a></span>sciousness, of the same nature, although sublimated, a consciousness
that is cognizant of us, in whose depths our memory lives for ever.</p>

<p>Perhaps by a supreme and desperate effort of resignation we might
succeed in making the sacrifice of our personality if we knew that in
dying it would go to enrich a Supreme Personality, a Supreme
Consciousness, if we knew that the Universal Soul was nourished by our
souls and had need of them. Perhaps we might meet death with a desperate
resignation or with a resigned desperation, delivering up our soul to
the soul of humanity, bequeathing to it our work, the work that bears
the stamp of our personality, if this humanity were in its turn to
bequeath its soul to another soul after the ultimate extinction of
consciousness upon this earth with its burden of longings. But if it be
otherwise?</p>

<p>And if the soul of humanity is eternal, if the human collective
consciousness is eternal, if there is a Consciousness of the Universe
and if this Consciousness is eternal, why should not our own individual
consciousness, yours, reader, and mine, not be eternal?</p>

<p>In the whole of the vast universe must there needs be such a thing as a
consciousness that knows itself, loves itself and feels itself, an
exception united to a organism that can only live between such and such
degrees of heat, a transitory phenomenon? No, it is not mere curiosity
to wish to know whether or not the stars are inhabited by living
organisms, by consciousness akin to our own, and there is an element of
profound longing in the dream of the transmigration of our souls through
the stars that people the vast remotenesses of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_221">{221}</a></span> the heavens. The feeling
of the divine makes us wish and believe that everything is animated,
that consciousness, in a greater or lesser degree, extends through all
things. We wish not only to save ourselves but to save the world from
nothingness. And therefore God. Such is His felt finality.</p>

<p>What would a universe be without any consciousness to reflect it and to
know it? What would the objectified reason be, without will and without
feeling? For us it would be the same as nothing&#8212;a thousand times more
dreadful than nothing.</p>

<p>If such a supposed universe is reality, then our life lacks value and
meaning.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, rational necessity but vital anguish that leads us
to believe in God. And to believe in God&#8212;I must repeat it again&#8212;is,
before all and above all, to feel hunger for God, hunger for divinity,
to feel the lack and absence of God, to wish that God may exist. And it
is to wish to save the human finality of the Universe. For we might even
succeed in resigning ourselves to being absorbed by God if our
consciousness rests upon a Consciousness, if consciousness is the end of
the Universe.</p>

<p>“The wicked man has said in his heart: There is no God.” And there is
truth in this. For it is possible for a righteous man to say in his
head: God does not exist. But only the wicked can say it in his heart.
Not to believe that there is a God or to believe that there is not a
God, is one thing; to resign oneself to there not being a God is another
thing, though an inhuman and horrible thing; but not to wish that there
is a God exceeds every other moral aberration. Al<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">{222}</a></span>though in fact those
who deny God do so because of their despair at not finding Him.</p>

<p>And now once again there comes the rational question, the question of
the Sphinx&#8212;the Sphinx, in effect, is reason&#8212;does God exist? This
eternal and eternalizing Person who gives meaning&#8212;I do not add “human,”
for there is no other meaning&#8212;to the universe, is He a substantial
something external to our consciousness, external to our desire? Here
you have something that is insoluble, and it is better that it should be
insoluble. Let it suffice for reason that the impossibility of His
existence cannot be proved.</p>

<p>To believe in God is to long for His existence, and, furthermore, it is
to act as if He existed. It is to live by this longing and to make it
the inner spring of our action.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>To believe is to place confidence in someone, and it has reference to a
person. I say that I know that there is an animal called the horse, and
that it has such and such characteristics, because I have seen it; and I
say that I believe in the existence of the giraffe or the
ornithorhyncus, and that it has such and such qualities, because I
believe those who assure me that they have seen it. And hence the
element of uncertainty that attaches to faith, for a person may be
deceived or he may deceive us.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, this personal element in belief gives it an
affective character, it connects it with love, and above all, in
religious faith, it carries with it a reference to what is hoped for.
Perhaps there is nobody who would sacrifice his life for the sake of
main<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_223">{223}</a></span>taining that the three angles of a triangle are together equal to
two right angles, for such a truth does not require the sacrifice of our
life; but on the other hand there are many who have lost their lives for
the sake of maintaining their religious faith, and it is martyrs that
make faith rather than faith that makes martyrs. For faith is not the
mere adherence of the intellect to an abstract principle; it is not the
recognition of a theoretical truth in which the will does nothing save
move us to understand; faith is a matter of the will, it is a movement
of the mind towards a practical truth, towards a person, towards
something that makes us live and not merely understand life.</p>

<p>But although we said that faith is a matter of the will, it would
perhaps be better to say that it is the will itself, the will not to
die, or rather some other psychic force distinct from intelligence, will
and feeling. We should then have feeling, knowing, willing, and
believing or creating. For neither feeling nor intelligence nor will
creates; they operate upon a material already given, upon a material
given by faith. Faith is the creating power of man. But since it has a
more intimate relation with the will than with any other of his
faculties, we present it under the form of volition.</p>

<p>Faith is, then, if not creative power, the fruit of the will, and its
function is to create. Faith, in a certain sense, creates its object.
And faith in God consists in creating God, and since it is God that
gives us faith in Him, it is God who is continually creating Himself in
us. Hence St. Augustine said: “I will seek Thee, Lord, by calling upon
Thee, and I will call upon Thee by believing in Thee. My faith calls
upon Thee, Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">{224}</a></span> the faith which Thou hast given me, with which Thou
hast inspired me through the Humanity of Thy Son, through the ministry
of the Preacher” (“Confessions,” Book I, chap. I). The power of creating
God in our own image and likeness, of personalizing the Universe, simply
means that we carry God within us, as the substance of what we hope for,
and that God is continually creating us in His image and likeness.</p>

<p>But after all this I shall be told that to show that faith creates its
own object is to show that this object is an object for faith alone,
that it has no objective reality external to faith itself&#8212;just as, on
the other hand, to maintain that faith is necessary in order to restrain
or to console people is to declare that the object of faith is illusory.
What is certain is that for thinking believers to-day, faith is, before
all and above all, wishing that God may exist.</p>

<p>Wishing that God may exist, and acting and feeling as if He did exist.
And it is in this way, wishing for God’s existence and acting
conformably with this desire, that we create God in ourselves, that is,
that God creates Himself in us, manifests Himself to us, opens and
reveals Himself to us. For God goes out to meet him who seeks Him with
love and by love and withdraws Himself from him who seeks Him with the
cold and loveless reason. God wills that the heart should have rest but
not the head, while in the physical life the head sometimes rests and
sleeps and the heart wakes and works unrestingly. And thus knowledge
without love removes us from God; and love, even without knowledge, and
perhaps better without it, leads<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_225">{225}</a></span> us to God, and through God to wisdom.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>

<p>&#160; </p>

<p>Faith is our longing for the eternal, for God; and hope is God’s
longing, the longing of the eternal, of the divine in us, which advances
to meet our faith and raises us up. Man aspires to God by faith and
cries to Him: “I believe&#8212;give me, Lord, wherein to believe.” And God,
the divinity in man, sends him hope in another life in order that he may
believe in it. Hope is the reward of faith. Only he who believes truly
hopes, and only he who truly hopes believes. We believe only what we
hope, and we hope only what we believe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_226">{226}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_SONG_OF_THE_ETERNAL_WATERS"></a>THE SONG OF THE ETERNAL WATERS</h2>

<p>The narrow road, hewn out of the naked rock, goes winding along above
the abyss. On one side rise high tors and crags, on the other side is
heard the ceaseless murmur of waters in the dark depths of the ravine,
deeper than eye can reach. At intervals the track widens so as to form a
kind of refuge, just large enough to hold about a dozen people, a
resting-place, screened by leafy branches, for those who travel along
the road above the ravine. In the distance, crowning the summit of a
jutting crag, a castle stands out against the sky. The clouds passing
over it are torn by the pinnacles of its tall towers.</p>

<p>With the pilgrims goes Maquetas. He walks hurriedly, sweating, seeing
nothing but the road in front of his eyes, except when from time to time
he raises them towards the castle. As he walks he sings an old wailing
song that his grandmother taught him when he was a child, and he sings
it so that he shall not hear the ominous murmur of the torrent flowing
unseen in the depths of the abyss.</p>

<p>As he approaches one of the resting-places, a maiden who is sitting
inside on a bank of turf calls to him:</p>

<p>“Maquetas, come here and stop awhile. Come and rest by my side, with
your back to the abyss, and let us talk a little. Nothing heartens us
for this journey<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_227">{227}</a></span> like a few words spoken in love and companionship.
Stay awhile here with me. Afterwards you will go on your way again
refreshed and renewed.”</p>

<p>“I cannot, my girl,” Maquetas replied, slowing his pace but without
halting, “I cannot. The castle is still a great way off and I must reach
it before the sun sets behind its towers.”</p>

<p>“You will lose nothing by staying here awhile, young man, for afterwards
you will take the road again with more mettle and with new strength. Are
you not tired?”</p>

<p>“That I am, lass.”</p>

<p>“Then stay awhile and rest. Here you have this turf for your couch and
my lap for your pillow. Come, stay!”</p>

<p>And she opened her arms, offering him her bosom.</p>

<p>Maquetas paused for a moment, and as he did so there came to his ears
the voice of the invisible torrent flowing in the depths of the abyss.
He quitted the road, stretched himself on the turf and laid his head on
the girl’s lap. With her fresh rosy hands she wiped the sweat from his
brow, while his eyes gazed up at the morning sky overhead, a sky that
was as young as the eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>“What is it you are singing, lass?”</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis not I singing&#8212;it is the water that flows down there, behind us.”</p>

<p>“And what is it that it sings?”</p>

<p>“It sings the song of eternal rest. But now rest yourself.”</p>

<p>“Eternal, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what the torrent sings. But now rest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">{228}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“And afterwards....”</p>

<p>“Rest, Maquetas, and don’t say ‘afterwards.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>The girl put her lips to his lips and kissed him. Maquetas felt the kiss
melt and flow through all his body, and so sweet it was that it seemed
as if all the sky poured itself down over him. His senses swooned. He
dreamed that he was falling endlessly down into the bottomless abyss....</p>

<p>When he awoke and opened his eyes he saw above him the sky of evening.</p>

<p>“O lass, how late it is! Now I shall not have time to reach the castle.
Let me go, let me go.”</p>

<p>“Go then, and God guide and companion you. And don’t forget me,
Maquetas.”</p>

<p>“Give me one kiss more.”</p>

<p>“Take it, and may it strengthen you.”</p>

<p>With the kiss Maquetas felt that his strength was increased a
hundredfold and he began to run along the road, the lilt of his song
keeping time with his strides. And he ran and ran, leaving the other
pilgrims behind him. One of them shouted to him as he passed:</p>

<p>“You’ll stop, Maquetas.”</p>

<p>Then he saw that the sun was beginning to set behind the towers of the
castle and Maquetas felt a chill strike his heart. The fires of the
sunset lasted but for a moment. He heard the grating of the chains of
the drawbridge. And Maquetas said to himself:</p>

<p>“They are shutting the castle-gate.”</p>

<p>Night began to fall, an impenetrable night. Very soon Maquetas had to
halt, for he could see nothing, absolutely nothing. Blackness enveloped
everything.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_229">{229}</a></span> Maquetas stood still, silent, and in the impenetrability of
the darkness he heard only the murmur of the waters of the torrent in
the abyss. The cold grew denser.</p>

<p>Maquetas stooped down, felt the road with his numb hands, and began to
creep along on all fours, warily, like a fox. He kept edging away from
the abyss.</p>

<p>He went forward like this for a long, long time. And he said to himself:</p>

<p>“Ah, that lass deceived me! Why did I heed her?”</p>

<p>The cold became horrible. It penetrated everywhere, like a
thousand-edged sword. Maquetas no longer felt the touch of the ground,
he no longer felt his own hands; he was benumbed. He stopped still. Or
rather he scarcely knew whether he was stopping or crawling.</p>

<p>Maquetas felt himself suspended in the midst of the darkness, black
night all around him. He heard nothing but the ceaseless murmur of the
waters of the abyss.</p>

<p>“I will call out,” Maquetas said to himself, and he made an effort to
shout. But no sound was heard; his voice did not come forth out of his
chest. It was as if it were frozen within him.</p>

<p>Then Maquetas thought:</p>

<p>“Can I be dead?”</p>

<p>And as this thought took hold of him, it seemed as if the darkness and
the cold fused together and eternalized themselves round about him.</p>

<p>“Can this be death?” Maquetas went on thinking. “Shall I have to live
henceforward like this, in pure thought, in memory? And the castle? And
the abyss? What do the waters say? What a dream,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_230">{230}</a></span> what an appalling
dream! And not to be able to sleep!... To die like this, dreaming, dying
little by little, and not to be able to sleep!... And now what am I
going to do? What shall I do to-morrow?</p>

<p>“To-morrow? What is to-morrow? What does to-morrow mean? What is this
idea of to-morrow that seems to come to me out of the depth of the
darkness, where the waters are singing? To-morrow? For me there is now
no to-morrow. Everything is now, everything is blackness and cold. Even
this song of the eternal waters seems like a song of ice&#8212;just one
prolonged note.</p>

<p>“But can I really have died? How long the dawn is in coming! But I don’t
even know how long it is since the sun set behind the towers of the
castle....</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” he went on thinking, “there was a man who was called
Maquetas, a great wayfarer, and he walked for days and days journeying
to a castle, where a good dinner awaited him and a warm fire and a good
bed to rest in, and in the bed a good bedmate. And there in the castle
he was going to live days without end, listening to stories that went on
for ever, joying in his sweet companion, a life of perpetual youth. And
those days would be all alike and all peaceful. And as they passed,
oblivion would fall on them. And all those days would be thus one
eternal day, one same day eternally renewed, a perpetual to-day
overflowing with a whole infinity of yesterdays and with a whole
infinity of to-morrows.</p>

<p>“And Maquetas believed that that was life, and set out on his journey.
And he journeyed on, stopping at inns where he slept, and when the sun
rose he went on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_231">{231}</a></span> his way again. And once, as he was leaving an inn, he
met an aged beggar who was sitting on the trunk of a tree by the door,
and the beggar said to him: ‘Maquetas, what meaning have things?’ And
that Maquetas answered him, shrugging his shoulders: ‘What does that
matter to me?’ And the aged beggar asked him again: ‘Maquetas, what does
this road mean?’ And that Maquetas, now somewhat irritated, answered
him: ‘Why do you ask me what the road means? How should I know? Does
anybody know? Does the road mean anything? Leave me in peace, and God be
with you.’ And the aged beggar knitted his brows and smiled sadly,
gazing on the ground.</p>

<p>“And then Maquetas came to a very rugged country and had to cross a wild
mountain ridge by a precipitous footpath hewn out of the rock, high up
over an abyss, in the depths of which sang the waters of an invisible
torrent. And thence he discerned afar the castle that he had to reach
before the sun set, and when he discerned it his heart leaped for joy in
his breast, and he quickened his steps. But a lass, sweet as a vision,
compelled him to stop and rest awhile on a bank of turf, and that
Maquetas rested his head on her lap and stopped. And when he left her
the lass gave him a kiss, the kiss of death, and as soon as the sun set
behind the towers of the castle the cold and the darkness closed in all
round him and the darkness and the cold grew denser and merged into one.
And there fell a silence from which only that song of the eternal waters
emerged. Yonder, in life, sounds, songs, murmurs, used to issue out of a
vague murmurous background, out of a kind of mist of sound; but here
this<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">{232}</a></span> song emerged out of the profound silence, the silence of darkness
and cold, the silence of death.</p>

<p>“Of death? Yes, of death, for that Maquetas, that valiant wayfarer,
died....</p>

<p>“How sweet the story is, and how sad! It is sweeter, far sweeter,
sadder, far sadder, than that old song my grandmother taught me. Let me
see, how does it go? I will repeat it over again.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was a man who was called Maquetas, a great
wayfarer, and he walked for days and days journeying to a castle....”</p>

<p>And Maquetas repeated to himself again and again and again and again the
story of that other Maquetas, and he continues repeating it and so he
will go on repeating it as long as the waters of the invisible torrent
go on singing, and the waters will sing for ever, ever, ever, without a
yesterday and without a to-morrow, for ever, ever, ever....<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_233">{233}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_TOWER_OF_MONTERREY"></a>THE TOWER OF MONTERREY</h2>

<p>It is freezing. A biting north wind cuts short the breath. From the
steely blue a pale sun sheds a glittering light that cuts out the
shadows and models the landscape into a kind of architectural relief.</p>

<p>For this crystal-clear light, bright as frost, without haze, appears not
so much to illumine as to civilize Nature; it makes it civil, which
means that it makes it more than human. To humanize is much, but to
civilize is more. To civilize, to make civil&#8212;or, if you like, to
citizenize&#8212;is to superhumanize. Humanity seems to us, so far as man is
concerned, to be everything; but civility embraces more than humanity;
it is more than all, for it is the future in never-ending process of
realization&#8212;it is the ideal. The all is that which is and that which is
permanent; but the more than all is that which, over and above all that
has been and is, will be. The all is the past that is condensed in the
present; the more than all is the eternity that embraces the past, the
present and the future. The all is the universe and the more than all is
thought. For thought exceeds all that has been thought and all that is
thinkable and goes beyond them.</p>

<p>The city also is Nature. Its streets and its squares and its erect
pillared towers also are landscape. And its lines are like the lines of
the country. Baroque lines they are said to be. But not all.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">{234}</a></span></p>

<p>The escarpments which slope down from the vast tableland of La Armuña to
the banks of the Tormes are like the buttresses of a gigantic cathedral;
they are architectonic. There are villages which seem as if they were
sculptured out of the earth of the bleak upland plains, out of the rock
itself. And if you look long enough at some dark poplar standing near
the spire of a village church, you begin to wonder which is the tree and
which the spire. And the skeleton trees, all swart naked bone, look like
the pillars of a ruined temple the roof of which has fallen in.</p>

<p>In travelling through this barren rocky Iberian land, have you never
sometimes fancied that you discerned in some distant craggy hill the
outline of a Baroque cathedral?</p>

<p>And conversely, here in the city, one might imagine oneself to be in the
midst of some vast geological formation. Men, like coral insects, have
built up these masses of grey and golden coral, gleaming in the naked
winter sun.</p>

<p>Every one of these fabrics of stone might be said to be an immense
architectonic phrase, an aphorism in lines. In a phrase culminates and
is condensed a whole system of ideas, of thoughts. In the title&#8212;<i>La
Vida es Sueño</i>&#8212;of Calderón’s drama, the immortal fellow of “Don
Quixote,” is condensed (as Farinelli rightly says in his work <i>La Vita é
un Sogno</i>, which I have just been reading) “the substance of all earthly
philosophies.” It was by a phrase that each of the seven wise men of
Greece won a lasting place in the memory of their race; for these seven
wise men eternalized themselves in the thought of their people as being
the authors of seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_235">{235}</a></span> single sentences. And a phrase, a civil sentence,
civil rather than human, is an edifice of thought in which economy of
material and of brute force has achieved its supreme triumph. The
Pyramids are phrases of stone which rise up from the sands of the
desert; and like an immense phrase, like one of the periods of
Demosthenes, or rather of Pericles, which Thucydides has bequeathed to
us for ever, stands the Parthenon. And these towers are phrases too,
civil phrases, phrases of civility now made one with Nature.</p>

<p>I know not how I am to translate to you in sounding words&#8212;words that
are winged, yet captive, words that fly and soar, yet abide&#8212;that which
this harmonious phrase of hewn stone, this tower of Monterrey, says to
me, says to us all, in the fine cutting light of these benumbing winter
mornings, when the frost sleeps idly on its lofty pinnacles; but I know
that it is a phrase when I see it clear-cut against the blue of heaven.
And if men pass away and yet abide, these stones will abide to tell
Nature that once there was Humanity, once there was thought; they will
abide to tell of plan, and of order, and of proportion, to the Universe.</p>

<p>And why should not the planets which journey through space in obedience
to the laws which they themselves communicated to Kepler, understand
geometry and mathematics? Is not the whole vast structure of the
Universe a great city, the city of God, its supreme Architect and
Inhabiter?</p>

<p>All this is a dream. True! But this dream of stone, in the clarified
frosty light, tells us that dream is what abides, the lasting, the
permanent, the substantial, and that on the surface of the dream, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_236">{236}</a></span>
waves on the surface of the sea, roll our sorrows and our joys, our
hates and our loves, our memories and our hopes. The waves are of the
sea; but the waves pass and the sea abides; the sorrows and the joys,
the hates and the loves, the memories and the hopes, are of the dream,
the dream of life; but they&#8212;sorrows, joys, hates, loves, memories,
hopes&#8212;pass away and the dream abides. And it abides thus, converted
into stone, stone of the earth, but civilized, civil or spiritual stone,
a phrase minted for ever, <i>monumentum ære perennius</i>, more enduring than
bronze.</p>

<p>This dream of stone enters into the soul and sinks into it, into the
innermost depths of it, into the soul’s soul, into what is innermost in
the soul itself, and it bears our soul along with it into the underlying
substance of all souls, fugitive waves submerged in the sea of souls. Is
it a sea? Is it liquid? Is it not rather a rocky floor, a plain, a stony
stratum of many mansions for civil human thought to dwell in? And is not
each one of our souls a stone which life hews&#8212;hews with hammer-strokes
of sorrow and joy, of hate and love, of memory and hope&#8212;so that it may
fit into the great civil, human cathedral, in the temple of our civil
and human God?</p>

<p>It was but yesterday, but a moment ago, that is to say it was five and
twenty years ago&#8212;the third of a full lifetime&#8212;that I first saw you,
tower of Monterrey, and you carry me beyond, far beyond, those
twenty-five years, back to when, before ever I was born, I beheld
you&#8212;where?&#8212;and in beholding you, you carry me from the midst of these
twenty-five years, beyond, far beyond, to when, after I am dead and dead
indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_237">{237}</a></span> I shall go on beholding you&#8212;this vision of you which in the
clarified frosty light is imprinted on my soul will abide with me, at
rest and buried deep in the sea of souls. Dream abides. It is the only
thing that abides; vision abides.</p>

<p>Spirit, when it suffers or rejoices, when it hates or loves, when it
remembers or hopes, becomes earth, becomes water, becomes fire or
becomes air; and stone, when it thinks and thinks civilly, becomes
abiding spirit, congealed, crystallized, substantivated. This tower is a
diamond of spirit.</p>

<p>And what does it say? It says nothing that is not itself; it says
itself, it proclaims itself immortal, it affirms itself. No matter if an
earthquake or a bombardment&#8212;which is another earthquake&#8212;or any other
accident that the hate of Nature or of man may bring about, throws you
to the ground and scatters your stones in confusion, tower of Monterrey,
for the vision of you will remain. It will remain fused in the souls
which behold you.</p>

<p>And to the soul that beholds you, tower of Monterrey, you say that he
says the utmost that can be said who says himself, who expresses his
person, who strips his spirit naked in the icy-clear light of the civil
world, standing statue-like before the world of men. The greatest thing
that men can see is another man, and if they but once saw him utterly
and completely, they would carry him with them for ever.</p>

<p>And this tower and other towers fill our soul with the tormenting
longing to say the unsayable, to leave in words that are borne on wings
of sound and pass away and are lost, something that does not pass away
and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_238">{238}</a></span> never lost. To say what one sees and to say it so that it is
seen in being heard; to see what is heard: that is the whole secret of
Art. Art makes the blind to see&#8212;and many are blind whose eyes reflect
the images of what they see upon the mind&#8212;and it makes them see with
the word; Art makes the deaf to hear&#8212;and many are deaf whose ears
vibrate with the sounds they hear round about them&#8212;and it makes them
hear with the vision. A poem gives sight to the blind; a picture gives
hearing to the deaf. Art fuses the senses, descending to that which
unites them in a common root and ascending to that which also unites
them in a common crown.</p>

<p>Tower of Monterrey, not the tower which I see with my eyes when I go
forth from my house on these benumbing mornings of clarified light to
read the divine Plato with my pupils&#8212;O noble word degraded to so
ignoble use!&#8212;my tower of Monterrey, the tower that I carry in the
crystal of my mind, as if it were a vision which by some enchantment had
remained frozen for ever upon the frozen surface of a lake, this tower
of mine tells me that he who says himself remains for ever too. It
matters not, my soul, what you say if you say yourself. For what art
thou but a phrase in the thought of God?</p>

<p>The thought of God is History: human history, civil history, the history
of this civil humanity in which God became man and dwelt among men, and
proclaimed that His kingdom, the kingdom of God, that is, the kingdom of
Man, the kingdom of God-Man, is not of this world of sorrows and joys,
of hates and loves, of memories and hopes. For the kingdom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_239">{239}</a></span> God, the
kingdom of Man, is of thought, which is above sorrow and joy, above hate
and love, above memory and hope, although it is made of these, as the
towers that abide in History are made of stones. The thought of God is
History; History is what God thinks, what He goes on thinking. And he
who lives in History, more or less audible and visible, whatever the
fashion of his life, however far beneath the surface, lives in the
thought of God, and, abiding in God’s thought, he abides in God. And
everyone who, willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly, helps
to make History, lives in History; everyone, however obscurely and
hesitatingly he lives, who has civil consciousness. Absolute death is
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>And this my tower of Monterrey speaks to me of our Renaissance, of the
Spanish renaissance, of the eternal essence of Spain, and tells me to
say my Spanish self and to affirm that if life is dream, dream is the
only thing that abides, and that the rest, all that is not dream, is
nothing but a process of digestion that passes away, as sorrow and joy,
hate and love, memory and hope, pass away. Yes, life without dream is
nothing but digestion and respiration, breath that vanishes. Breath,
air, <i>pneuma</i>, <i>anima</i>, <i>spiritus</i>, such are the names that have been
given to the life that animates the body but is not dream; and the
breath passes away, but the dream abides.</p>

<p>“Life is dream!” affirmed the man, the Spaniard, who believed in the
eternal and the substantial, and those who do not believe in it say in
the foolishness of their hearts: “Life is breath!” And the tower of
Monterrey, my tower of Monterrey, my tower of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">{240}</a></span> Spanish renaissance,
of renaissant Spanishness, tells me that life is not breath that passes
away and is lost, but dream that abides and triumphs.</p>

<p>When I go forth in the morning and the tower says to me: “Here am I!” I,
beholding it, say to it: “Here am I!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_241">{241}</a></span>”</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Unamuno describes his “Commentary upon the Life of Don
Quixote” as “a free and personal exegesis.” “I do not think I need
repeat,” he says in his preface, “that I feel myself to be a Quixotist
rather than a Cervantist and that I have allowed myself sometimes even
to differ from the way in which Cervantes understood and dealt with his
two heroes. The truth is, I believe that these fictitious personages
possess a life of their own, with a certain autonomy, within the mind of
the author who created them, and that they obey an inner logic of which
the author himself is not wholly conscious.” Cervantes did not so much
create them, he maintains, as derive them from the spiritual depths of
the Spanish people, and therefore it is possible for us to understand
them better even than their author. It may be conjectured that Unamuno
can never quite forgive the slightly ironical attitude that Cervantes
always adopts towards his hero.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It will be remembered that Don Quixote, otherwise known as
Alonso Quixano, when he turned knight-errant, resolved that it was
proper for him to have some lady to whom he might send the trophies of
his valour. Accordingly he chose for his mistress one Aldonza Lorenzo,
“a good, likely country lass,” for whom he had long cherished an
unavowed passion. He bestowed upon her the name of Dulcinea, with the
addition of Del Toboso from the place where she was born.
</p><p>
According to Unamuno’s exegesis, Dulcinea stands “for glory, for life,
for survival.”</p></div>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
